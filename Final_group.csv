prkskd,How to do keto when you cant cook,"Im a student and i live in a dorm and dont have access to the kitchen. I would love to cook, but i literally cant. Online i was looking for keto recipes that wouldnt require me to cook. I found some good ones such as those avocado salads and more salads. I can buy steamed chicken breast that is a package, and boiled eggs. Im also considering to eat the right nuts to fill in the remaining calories, which of course i would measure so i wouldnt go overboard with calories.
So im curious has anyone been through a similar situation and what did you eat? What did you buy? Or does anyone else have some no cook recipes to suggest? 
Im very new to keto and ive been doing research online and im fully ready to commit to it. Im trying to find more tools that would help me out
Oh and im considering getting an electric pot where u can make soups and stews(?), it is possible to make keto friendly foods with it?",keto,1

prkn15,Cholesterol//Keto love,"I'm like 16 days in. I read a negative article. Apparently doctors and nutritionists say Keto is the worst. I also know a nutritionist who ate loads of bacon (Dan The Bacon Man) who had his cholesterol tested for months and it was always normal, he proved this to his followers by actually showing the paperwork.

What causes high cholesterol and should ketoers be worried about it since it's basically a lifestyle change for long term? 

You can lower cholesterol by diet, correct? 

Is equating high cholesterol to Keto just flat out wrong? 

Also... I ate a couple hundred grams of carbs yesterday, just to test what would happen. Suddenly had insomnia, heart burn, was constantly hungry, lazy, bad mood. Fuck all that noise. I ate *twice* today, avocado for breakfast and then dinner. Not hungry once. I love Keto. I'm loving the flavoured salt water a bit too much.",keto,1

Of course, reducing carbs to a minimum is the goal and that the slower carbs are less detrimental but i can get confused when it's about a tiny quantity of fast carbs vs a less little medium speed carbs.

For example how would you rank those and why?

- crispy fried chicken
- a salad with stripes of onion and carrots in it
- a premade dry seasoning that contains a bit of sugar
- non-homemade mayonnaise that contain somehow sugar in the ingredients
- soy sauce",keto,1

What does the data show about the link between keto and longevity/ health?

Stop telling people to drink tons of supplements.- Which is also to a large extent corrupt like the pharmaseutical industry... The need for supplementation just proves that the/a diet has error. In nature you do not see an animal needing supplementation because it eats foods, it was designed to eat. 

Likewise we should also be in accordance with nature - in terms of our diet and our physiology (And in many other areas of life and our broken society.)

After logging my day, which is typical for a work day apparently I have been undereating, like below 1000 calories on my work days.  I was binging the odd day, and summer usually means alcohol on the odd golf day or football game.  I assume those two things are  causing the stalling problem but with that realization I am going to start logging daily again,  it's quick and easy, and being lazy about it may have been the stalling cause.

pqy23b,Down 42 pounds in four months. Also some thoughts on metabolism.,"I am down 42 pounds in four months. What is interesting is for about 3 weeks I introduced a diet with carbs at the same calories intake of 2000 calories.  I didn't lose a single pound instead I gained 4 pounds.  I think I can say there is something abnormal in my metabolism and how I react to insulin.  I am going to get a full metabolic and hormonal panel done Monday morning.  
Another interesting note is that I have full on truncal obesity where I carry very little fat on the rest of my body- I just developed a giant gut.  So much so I actually thought there was something wrong with my stomach because it felt permanently distended like I had a blockage or tumor or something- I am starting to realize it is just the fat that gave me a constant uncomfortable feeling of being bloated.  This distended, hard abdomen form of obesity is common in older men and suggests hormonal issues and insulin issues that comes with aging combined with poor diet.  I am 32 and so I suspect I have or hopefully HAD some hormonal issues.

I think the keto diet is an effective way to improve health in people specifically with hormonal/metabolic issues.  The keto diet really proves it's not just about calories for weight loss because I would many times eat In a small surplus and still lose weight steadily.  I think I will be keto long term for health and weight loss whole introducing healthy carbs periodically like fruit and high quality bread.  I am hoping to get down to my college weight of 200.

I started at 260 lbs, down to 251 this morning. 

I make a keto-ade with 1/4 tsp lite salt, and 1/4 tsp sea salt in a 16oz water bottle. Usually 2 a day sometimes 3. I take magnesium citrate 425 mg daily. This easily hits potassium and magnesium goals. Usually makes up the difference in sodium with what i eat.

pqr6lp,How to maintain weight on keto,"I started 4 months ago at 165lbs. (F 5'3"") and today I'm 9 lbs away from my goal weight of 125lbs. 

Once I reach my goal, what are my options to maintain?
I know the common wisdom on this sub is to increase calories while keeping the carbs more or less the same level (continuing the state of ketosis).

This makes sense to me on many levels, and besides this is the keto sub, not low-carb or cico one, but I have an issue with this.

I never regained my appetite on this diet. Usually the lack of it lasts for a little while at the beginning, but throughout my keto stint so far, for me it's almost not existing. I'm struggling with getting adequate protein as is. I hardly have appetite and most days I'm below 1,200 calories. I can't imagine eating much more than that. I know there is a graph, which I have checked out at some point in the FAQ with the recommend calories to maintain and it's quite high for me. 

Another option for me is to increase my carbs intake (Atkins like style) until I reach what they call carb equilibrium and not go over that threshold, so I simply maintain my weight.

The problem with this and I've been there, done that - is thanks carb creep happens and before I know it I'm slipping more and more and the lost weight creeps back up.

pqq2qy,Depression and anxiety on day 4/5 of keto,"I had debilitating depression yestersay afternoon that was kind of scary and unlike anythjng I’ve ever had. And, the last few days I had increased anxiety, with this morning culminating into one of the worst panic attacks I’ve ever had. We’re talking shaking, crying, being convinced I was dying, pacing, and finally relenting and taking a xanax - it was awful. I do have anxiety disorder, but I’m well versed in controlling it and it never gets this bad. For instance, I reserve xanax for the worst of the worst and usually take it like once a year, if that. This was like in my top two panic attacks of all time, and I’ve been living with anxiety for decades.

I’m on day 5ish of keto and it was going really well and I was super happy with it. I’m a big fan of low carb/keto, and I have a long history with it. However, my experience in the last 24 hours really freaked me out and I don’t know if I’ll continue. I’m just really frustrated because I also have PCOS and other diets truly don’t seem to work for me - for instance, because of the insulin issues of PCOS, I don’t usually lose on CICO unless I eat around 1,000 calories a day and that’s going and not really sustainable. One different from the last time I tried keto is that I’m now also on a low dose of metformin after I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes a few months ago. So, I wonder if metformin sort of intensified the effects of keto? I checked my fasting sugar this morning and it was great for me (115) - way better than usual 130 from before I started keto - but not low by any means.

Anyway, I guess I’m just ranting. It was a really rough morning. I know this could be an electrolyte issue, so I took my multivitamin (which I forgot to take yesterday) and I had a little salt. I had a piece of toast and half an order of hash browns for breakfast - to get a few carbs in my system and becaue I’m not sure if I’ll continue with keto even though I’d like to.

And I am. It's gotten a lot better in the month that I have been on Keto so far but I still feel like munching all day long on pork rinds, nuts etc.

The difference is that my relationship with hunger has completely changed.

Now I sense it, recognize it for what it is, think about whether it's appropriate or not to eat, think to see if it's reasonable for me to be ""hungry"" now or not (for example if I just ate a meal an hour ago) and understand that it's not gonna kill me to wait until proper eating time OR more importantly, recognize that IT WILL GO AWAY.

If I just let it sit for a while, it literally goes away and this makes sense physiologically because of the way hunger hormones are secreted. 

When I was eating high carbs or highly processed food I was just freaking. Powerless. I felt so defeated everytime I wanted to stop snacking and I failed and indulged on some random ass garbage food. 

Now I recognize it's like 10% will power and 90% the types of foods you eat. 

For example last night I ate dinner at 6. I was full. Around 10 pm I got cravings for nuts and I said to myself no need. I'm gonna drink water and go to bed.  I don't have to or need to keep eating all the time to satisfy my every desire.",keto,1

Hey, in attempting to stop gaining weight / loose some I've started fasting. I don't know if it would count as intermittent fasting because relatively frequently I go 24+ hours without  eating.

As a compromise I wanted to shift my diet more in the direction of Keto but don't really know how to start and know that I'll be bad at keeping track of it.

Do you guys have opinions on whether this is a good idea or any advice for me? Also does anybody know a good app that could track Keto and Fasting at the same time? 

The Fasting app I use right now is a little wonky if you fast for 24+ hours and does not handle a varied schedule well.

pq7ekb,Keto for post-surgery blood sugar control in Type 2 Diabetic,"This is a thank you post more than anything else. 

SOME HISTORY: My husband and I are both Type 2 Diabetics. Through this community I learned about Keto a little over 2 years ago. Though we don't (yet) have the self-control necessary to eat Keto full-time, we've used the information to slash our carb intake dramatically and are slowly making progress toward adjusting our diet to more closely match Keto a greater percentage of the time. Doing so allowed us to bring our blood sugar under control (A1C 5.4), though some medications are still needed. Prior to finding this community, my husband's blood sugar was unmanageable and it was doing significant damage to his body. My husband had abnormal liver and kidney function test results, leaking blood vessels in his feet and eyes, gastroparesis, and possibly some autonomic dysfunction.The dietician our doctor sent us to several years ago said to include ""healthy whole grains"" in our diet. By ignoring the dietician's advice and instead listening to this community, my husband's latest blood work shows everything is now in the ""normal"" range, and nearly all other indicators of the damage caused by high blood sugar have been reversed (still a few tiny spots on his feet where blood vessels might yet need to heal up). 30+ years of damage nearly erased after 2 years of not-quite-Keto. 

THE REASON FOR MY POST TODAY: Yesterday morning my husband had surgery to correct a deviated septum and shave down some bony overgrowths in his sinuses (yay allergies). His blood sugar spiked hard because of the stress to his body, going high enough that the level would ultimately slow healing and even do damage to his body. By dropping his carb intake down to full Keto levels I was able to bring his blood sugar back to acceptable levels by bedtime and solidly within the safe range by morning (though it's still significantly higher than it would normally be with such low carb intake). I'm going to keep him at Keto levels of carbs at least until he's healed up enough to fight me on it. :)

Thank you so very much to this community. You're a life saver.",keto,1

So far I have break days where I carb load then move back onto keto for another week then break. This has helped me avoid plateaus but has reduced my weight loss a bit, I'd rather have a sustainable weight loss then one that plateaus and eventually I get demotivated and start eating carbs all the time again.

The first year I lost close to 60 lbs and eventually hit 75lb down by Dec 2019. I was training for my first half marathon in the latter part of 2019.

After that I stopped running and wasnt as strict on the diet. Those first few months of covid were plagued with disaster. Casual drinking increased, diet loosened and exercise wasn't as consistent. 

I ended up gaining back close to 20lbs through the course of 2020. The first half of 2021 was filled with vacations new life events and celebrations. Fun, but definitely took a toll on my diet. I dropped 5 lbs when i started to get back in the groove, but hit a period where i cheated wayyyy too often. Ended up gaining another 20lbs. 

For those keeping track thats now +35lbs from my lowest in early 2020 (204).

Last month decided enough was enough and needed to get back on track. Dropped the first 9 pounds pretty easily in the first 2 weeks, but now I have hit a stall.

Diet has been pretty good. Salads mostly, good fats and protein. My GKI has been averaging around 2 for the past month. I typically check before lunch when the only thing I have had in my system is coffee with heavy cream. I am either running or cycling 6 days a week.

Haven't seen this stubborn of a stall going on 2.5 weeks. All the easy tips i have read dont seem to be the issue. Diet and exercise are both going well.

pq19v3,SV: I'm actually losing weight at my parents',"This is gonna be pretty specific, but I want to talk about an unforeseen benefit of keto.

I live in Europe, and back home, I have the discipline to eat strict keto with good, balanced meals. I've been on CICO-like diets before, and I've achieved good success at losing weight on them.

But then, every year, I spend some time with my parents in Canada, and invariably, my diet has been derailed. My parents' habits are... less than ideal. My mom eats decently, but my dad is a carb machine. And out of simply wanting me to be happy and comfy with them, they can get pushy with the desserts of the second servings.

So every year, I'd do well in the spring, then regain weight in the summer months as I spend time with my parents and counting calories becomes impossible.

Except this year, thanks to keto!

What keto does to me is that I have clearly-defined rules that I can follow in ""lazy keto"" mode. Sorry, dad, I can't have any donut for dessert. No, thank you, mom, I'll just have salad instead of potatoes with my meal.

I know weight loss comes down to CICO, of course, but doing lazy keto + IF 16:8 means I stay at a caloric deficit without having to count.

There's also a great power in saying ""I can't have this"" instead of ""I shouldn't have so much of that."" The absolute rule (""that's too much carbs, I can't have any"") means I can turn down stuff politely.

The result? My weight loss isn't at optimal velocity compared to back home, but even while at my parents', the scale is definitely going down! I'm going back home in a few weeks, and I'm confident I'll be able to return on strict keto for the rest of the year.

I can't tell you how momentous this is for me. I've just broken a cycle that's been going on for a decade.

I had an interesting encounter the other day. I was due for my annual physical. Funny enough, my doctor’s concern for my cholesterol at my last year physical was one of the big things that pushed me to try keto. 

Needless to say he was gobsmacked when I showed up almost 100 lbs lighter. He commended me on the discipline it took to do something like that and said that people often go from obese to overweight or vice versa in a year but that he never sees someone go from obese to normal in that span of time. This stuff works!!

He relayed that he tells patients struggling with weight to “eat like a diabetic and no more than 200 carbs a day with an hour of extremely vigorous exercise, which is meant to burn all of the carbs”. The dude is a slab of muscle in his 70s so I have no doubt he practices what he preaches but I thought it was interesting and validating that my medical professional had embraced keto or keto-proximate nutritional practices. 

I know many folks on here have had mixed experiences dealing with keto and medical professionals so that experience definitely made me hopeful for the future.",keto,1

ppbvkq,Conventional nutritional advice is... Sick,"My mom just got home from a hospital, where she was recovering from a neck injury.
Everything is going well, she's getting a lot better, but the food at the hospital and nutritional advice from her doctor is... Just horrifying to me.
They feed patients semolina porridge with bread for breakfast, vegetable soup with a tiny bit of very lean beef for lunch, cookies for snacks and pasta or buckwheat for dinner. 
For those lying in their beds all day it is an incredible amount of carbs with very little protein and almost no fat. No doubt why my mother has put on a few kilos.
But the advice they gave her to take home is even worse. The doctor said that she should not eat any salt and cholesterol-containing foods (like meat, eggs, butter and other animal foods, that are not super-lean). 
And she believes that it reasonable, since her blood cholesterol is a bit too high.

That's especially sad for me, as she won't listen to anything else other than this stupid conventional medical advice. She's overweight, tried to lose some, but didn't succeed and believes keto is a great way to get a heart attack and die at the age of 30.

poxbwx,keto and carb question,i been on keto for about 5 months now. when i started i was eating about 20g of carb a day for the first 3 months and was fasting in between to. i went from 111kg to 92kg in that time. now i got stuck at 88kg for a while so the last month i went to 0 carbs and i hit 85.5kg.  now i fasted for 6 days in a row just to see what would happen to my body and weight. and i hit 81kg was so happy went back to eating 0 carbs and was a steady 82 to 82.30kg. last night i was craving bread so i got this keto bread 8carbs per piece i had 2 for dinner with my chicken and and protein shake in the mornings . i went from the morning 82.20kg 14hrs of no food or water i slept a lot to 83kg can someone explain how that works. i did have a shower yesterday but 0.80kg seems a bit extreme just for 16grams of carb. my goal was 75kg before i start eating more carbs and try and get off the keto diet slowly since im over high fat food never was a meat person tbh. but that seems to far away im working out so don't know how much i am muscle wise. was thinking if doing 20 carbs a day and every week increase it by 5grams of carb i know this isn't fast i gained but don't know what it is sorry for the long question just a bit stressed out,keto,1

poszks,4 Days into Keto Diet,"Hello Everyone, 

I recently started keto and have a few questions. I am trying the keto diet after reading the benefits of it in regards to glutamate/GABA. I am going through benzo withdrawal and have spoken with others who healed faster on keto. 

 [Ketosis and Brain Handling of Glutamate, Glutamine,](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2722878/)[ and GABA (nih.gov)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2722878/) 

The first 3 days, I noticed my concentration/focus was much better, and I had a lot of natural energy.

Yesterday I started to feel increased anxiety, and as the day went on, the energy levels increased to the point of being scary, and I started to have a panic attack. Along with the energy, I was itchy all over; my heart was racing/pounding, weird aches and pressure all over my body.  

I ended up eating half an apple, and the sensation calmed down 50%. That night I tried to go to sleep, but I felt so restless and didn't end up sleeping until 7 am. It is 1 PM now.  I had another half an apple around 2 AM.

There are a few things that I think might be wrong.

1.  Yesterday for dinner, I put Morton Lite Salt in a recipe - too much potassium at once?
2. Not enough electrolytes - I made a ketoade right after the panic episode.  I put 1/2 tsp of nu salt and 1/4 tsp of iodized salt in 5 cups of water and sipped over 4 hours. I felt slightly better but was still having palpitations and irritable feelings.
3. Not enough magnesium - I completed lost my appetite the second day in keto and was eating something for dinner the past 4 days. I was used to eating lots of fruits and rice before—Paleo type diet. So possible severe calorie deficit combined with intermittent fasting and not enough nutrition in general.
4. Releasing stored toxins - since I was IF, I am wondering I was releasing toxins, and since I am not taking a binder, I could not get rid of them?
5. Magnesium - not enough magnesium. I cannot tolerate supplements of magnesium. So I need to figure out a way to eat enough during the day from food. Pumpkin seeds?
6. Not the diet for me - I have heard some people cannot tolerate this diet, but I was feeling better than I have in a while from the benzo withdrawal.

I would appreciate it if anyone could suggest what I might be doing wrong besides not eating enough calories. 

Also, the new symptoms I am experiencing. Palpitations (especially in the morning), racing heart, tightness, irritability, etc., are not from benzo withdrawal.

posulh,Keto seems to have improved ADHD and anxiety symptoms.,"I've been doing keto for about a month now, and low fructose (but normal or high carb) for three years before that. Other than some minor weight loss that's I'm not explicitly focusing on (no calorie counting, at least for now), I've noticed some mental improvements.

The usually resistance I have to doing things- the ""wall of awful"" that separates me and the thing I want to do- is lower. Still there, and I still struggle, but I objectively get more done during the day (+ ~2 more actions) than I had previously. I forget fewer things. Still do, yes, but the incidence per day is lower (&gt;5 to ~3). I can focus longer on episodes of shows by about one to two minutes.

I managed to _actually_ play games I like, _several times._ I even did household chores faster than normaly.

Another effect is lower anxiety. Yes, the world is still terrifying, and that knot in my stomach is still tight and feeds me doomsday scenarios- but I can do some things and even not cry! Last week I did something very scary for me, and even managed to keep my voice level most of the time.

My hope is that if I stay keto, these benefits will also stay, and maybe even continue to improve. If not, it's still some measurable improvement, and if it does then I am doing this for life and never looking back.",keto,1

And no, I didn’t do any exercise yesterday. If I had only 20 lbs to lose than fine, but I need to lose a minimum of 80 and so these fluctuations just make me want to scream and cry.

I'm very happy with the information and support provided here, so thank you all!

Because I'm sometimes tired of not feeling great, even after all those weeks, I increased my salt use (which already helped a lot!) And I bought my first magnesium and potassium supplements. I'm careful with supplements because I have had kidney stones in the past, which I connect to supplements that I took in that period, so I just want to take the minimum.

I'm currently, only since yesterday, taking magnesium bisglycinate 150mg, one a day. I wanted to combine this with magnesium and potassium citrate (60mg and 225mg) that I ordered from Amazon Germany. I read that both magnesium types are differently absorbed, one in the muscles and one in the brain etc. These last ones from Amazon arrived yesterday, but they are not exactly as specified. Apart from magnesium and potassium as described, they also contain 120mg of L-leucin. I looked this up, and it doesn't seem bad to take them, but does anyone has experience with it or any advice?

Currently at 248-250. Last month about 33 days ago I was at 252. For 2 weeks my weight on the scale refused to move, +-1-2 lbs here and there, but otherwise hardstuck. I was extremely frustrated and decided to shake things up, ate pork shoulder/loin dryrubbed airfryer recipe + beef steak w/ airfry kale chips + mutton chops airfryer dryrub for a week, still never exceeding 1500 calories. This past week I've gone back to my old eating habits because it's easier for me, but my weight is still hardstuck at 250.

I drink alcohol maybe once a week, nothing excessive, like 4-5 shots of Tequila at most once a week on the weekend with friends. No mixers, no cheat meals etc. I took a really small bite of poutine last weekend b/c haven't had it in 2 years almost, but it definitely wasn't anything over like 5g of carbs and my net carbs were easily under 10g that day. Anytime i even slightly cheat, it's always within my 6-10PM eating window of OMAD and it's never more than like 1/2 of a teaspoons worth for the taste alone. Definitely not enough to break my keto or my macros.

My macro's are around 1400\~ calories at most daily.

For the past 3 months, I eat 500g of boneless skinless chicken breast w/ Nando's Hot Sauce or Sour Cream. 100g of Cheddar/Moz/Feta/Cream cheese. On days I'm extra hungry I'll add in 100g of pure turkey breast slices with 50g of cheese and go overboard on calories, but that hasn't happened more than once a week. I drink 1 protein shake with Muscletech French Vanilla (2g net carbs, 2g fat, 24g protein), with Alpro no sugar coconut milk (around 100ml/30 calories worth), ice and on spinach days with chia seeds for the fiber.

My OMAD is around 6-8PM daily. I will drink my protein shake when I finish work post-6 while cooking up my food. Diary for the last 7-10 days looks like this;

1x Muscletech french vanilla protein shake w/ creatine, occasional chia seeds/1-2 strawberries (never over 35g)/couple of blueberries(50g at most) put in - 140 calories on average, never over 160. I use this to break my fast.

500g Boneless Skinless Chicken breast w/ no added sugars - 110g protein, 11g fat, 0g carbs - 550 calories

500g of Broccoli, Spinach, Molokhovia - Broccoli gets airfried with 1tbsp olive oil and salt/pepper, 20g carbs, 12g protein, \~300 cal. Spinach just gets cooked in the same pan I use for the chicken so it soaks up leftover oils, 9g carbs, 2g fats, 15g protein approx 150-200 cals.

\~50ml or 4 tablespoons of Ghee or Coconut oil on 80% of days, with Olive oil on the other 20% - 500 cals, I use less oil on broccoli days to accommodate. Plus there's usually at least like 10-20ml of oil leftover in the bowl if I manage to finish eating.

\- Other things include Coke Zero's (1 can/every other day on average, never more than 2/day, exclusively with meals), Homebrew iced americanos (Just espresso w/ water. no sweeteners/dairy), Oolong tea or Black tea w/ mint.

\- Supplements ; Biotin, Vit D3, Vit B12, Omega 3 fish oil 4x 180/120 daily (Had eye surgery, was on 2x/day prior), Occasional Vit C, Iron, Potassium Chloride, Magnesium, L-Theanine and Caffeine mix.

I take my supplements at night after eating, except for the Omega 3 fish oil which I normally take with my protein shakes. It gives me yucky burps if I take it post-food. I started Potassium Chloride and Magnesium last month after having some muscle cramps related to electrolyte deficiencies which increased after I started tracking my water intake (1gal/day at minimum usually)

I've stopped using garlic powder, most chili powders, haven't even had nando's xxx-tra hot sauce this week just to cut it down to purely salt + pepper + clean/easy nutrition this week just to see if anything changes but nothing is.

I also got my blood tested last week, blood sugar is at 72 (low), cholesterol levels are perfectly normal, my RBC numbers were a little weird last test (mid july) which is when I started iron supplements and it climbed back to normal as of most recent tests.

Macros are somewhere around 160g protein, 17g net carbs and 80g fats. I usually get 150g of protein on average daily and 70g of fats. I normally also ate eggs instead of chicken, but on those days I end up eating around 7 medium pasteurized eggs/150-200g spinach/1-2tbsp butter/lots of cheese to still hit around 1200-1300 calories and add a 2nd protein shake to hit the protein goals.

Any suggestions? This block really has me going on full tilt, I am considering spending a week or two off Keto, binging on foods I miss while calorie counting before returning to Keto, but it's just a fantasy. I'm \~10 months away from my GW and would really like to just ride it out at once, but this month long stall has my mood ruined. In between work stress and stall stress it's super hard right now to not binge, looking at MFP when I see the -62.7lbs lost, 311.7 start and 172 goal, it's really motivating to see I'm almost at the halfway point.. but that motivation has been dying this past month because ""It's right there..."" and I'm not moving.",keto,1

Unfortunately, since I’ve been diagnosed with CSID and started eating “keto”, I’ve lost 10 pounds and I’m now underweight.

pocqy1,"Observations regarding Keto, Major Surgery and Recovery-- long post lol.","So, in November I celebrate 3 glorious keto years!

Now for the last several months, my keto has been rock solid as ever, though all my food was pureed. 

I have been dealing with a rather bizarre and potentially really serious mouth issue, but since I have been really symptom free and figured it wasn't relevant, I didn't bring it up. 

Ultimately, I went in for surgery on the 10th, to have half my mouth, part of my tongue removed and reconstructed, plus 3 lymph glands removed. I won't know for a week or so whether cancer is the final outcome, or what else I might face. But that is OK. 

Naturally this worried me, as it was my first hospital stay since I started keto, my most radical surgery ever. 

FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS, I KICKED BUTT LOL.

I made it crystal clear to the hospital that there would be no carbs. Period, end of story, and my doc backed me up. My hubby had protein shakes and broth on hand, and plenty of lite salt. 

It was mind boggling. I was told to expect a 5 day stay, severe bruising, insulin to counteract hyperglycemia from surgery trauma and steroids. And the patients I saw who had lesser forms of the same surgery had all that.

They said I might be unable to talk for days....

Well, none of that happened. Very mild swelling, very light bruising, I was talking hours after I hit my room.

Even with the surgery shock and steroid load, my blood sugar never topped 140. 0 insulin. 

I came home Sunday, with 1 neck drain already out, and haven't taken a prescription pain med since I got out. Halfway through the steroid pack, blood sugar is now rock steady between 100 and 120 max, 90 baseline. Maintaining my calories easily, no cravings or other issues. 

Contrast this with my last hospital stay pre keto, when I dang near died of pneumonia and they couldn't get my blood sugar below 200 for 2 weeks....

Or my last surgery 5 years ago, when I had major inflammation, major bruising, major blood sugar issues and a horrible recovery curve for a relatively minor laparoscopic procedure...

I am absolutely convinced keto is the difference here. The lady in the room next door had less removed a day before me, and she looked like she got hit by a truck, was getting liquids by tube on a ""diabetic diet"" at 100g net daily, 3 meals, 2 snacks, insulin... Yikes. They had her on steroids, Lasix, insulin and she was not a happy camper. 

The hospital, by the way, was very good at burning broth. No idea how they managed it. 

The hospital dietitian got a talking to by my doc. had some bizarre idea she was going to stick me on a pure liquid plant based diet, 100g net. I told her no thank you, I like living. She was displeased. Oh well. 

So, if you need surgery, get your doc to mandate keto, and arrange for friends or fam to bring food lol. 

As to living on liquid keto, if you can afford it I think keto chow is likely good. 

I will say cream of cheeseburger soup is good, and I was surprised that my favorite coconut chicken curry soup suffers when pureed. No idea why, but some foods taste far better with less texture than they did straight pureed. Like the cream of cheeseburger. Pureed to pate consistency it is depressing. As a creamy melted ice cream consistency soup it is dang good. 

Go figure.

All things considered, this is going great! Less pain than expected, less swelling, home early, happy docs and i am a happy camper. 

Oh, and going camping this weekend too. 

If anyone has any favorite soup recipes that I can cream in the blender feel free to post them lol. I have at least another month of no solids to deal with!!

pobb6m,100lbs Lost &amp; Hoping to Never Find Again,"M/31 6'2"" started at 371. This morning 266 and some change

Like a lot of people here, I started this journey with little knowledge, and even less belief that I could do something like this. As of this morning I have broken past the 100 pound mark, and have been smiling ever since. I still have a ton of work to do on myself, I don't look anywhere near what a lot of people do when they post 100+ drops on here. But I am happy compared to where I started. I still have days where it's tough to see what I have done vs. what I have left to do.

I won't say that this journey has been easy. There were days where all I wanted to do was smash an unhealthy amount of fast food. Or lose myself in a pint of Ben and Jerry's (or two). I have to remind myself, I was an addict and still am. But Looking at my before vs. the pictures I took this morning. I have found a new sense of direction and motivation.

If there is anyone who reads this, and they are sitting on the fence about making the change. DO IT! Because you can do it. You are taking that first step by just being on this group. Every obstacle that came at me, every late night craving for a binge, every opportunity life presented to give myself an excuse to break was just a test (I did break once, but got back on the horse). I think I read it or saw it on here. ""To get something you've never had. You must be willing to do something you've never done"". I am sitting here today knowing I am not done. I still have 56 more lbs. to get to my new stretched out goal. But I am going to do it.

poax63,Top 10 statements from non-keto people,"Hi all,

I am a 36 year old male. SW: 122kg, CW:88kg, GW: 85kg. Keto and IF.

It has been hard to say ""no thanks"" to the carby stuff in the beginning, but it is much easier now.

Through my keto journey, I have had a lot of comments and statements from non-keto friends and family. Although I learned not to say the word ""keto"", I will explain this way of living to those who ask.

My top 10 comments/statements from non-keto people, what I think and sometimes dare to reply.

1) You will die from a heart attack! (I might, it is the most common way to go, when you become old). 

2) What do you eat then? (The most filling and delicious meals you could ever imagine!).

3) Breakfast is the most important meal! (Yes according to Kelloggs it is).

4) Cutting out a whole food group is bad for you! (I do bot consider highly processed things a food group).

5) Yeah but you exercise a lot dont you? (I sprint getting my pork rinds!).

6) Your cholesteral will go through the roof! (Yes but only the good ones!).

7) A little bit of sugar wont hurt you. (Yes it will, and have).

8) Not eating what is served is impolite. (Well, then call me a ""carb vegan"").

9) But you have become skin and bones! (Yes, and it feels AMAZING!).

10) It is all about calories in, calories out! (So 100g of sugar = 125g of ripeye???).

I know #10 is highly discussed. 😀

For me the positives from this way of eating is incredible! People close to me start to come around and accept it (not doing it though) when I tell them that: I am medicine FREE!, GERD is gone, eczema is gone, high blood pressure is now back to normal, fatty liver reversed, (had high liver test numbers before keto, now perfect), better sleep due to reduced sleep apnea, no more excessive sweating, I can now play ball with my 2 sons for more than 5 mins, mental clearity, and yes ofcourse the side benefit og losing a lot of weight! 😀

Maybe what I am trying to say here is that, do NOT let anyone tell you what you are doing for yourself and your health is wrong, no matter what they come up with.

Please add to the list which statements/comments non-keto people have said to you.

High rates of retention, adherence, and safety appear to be achievable in applying a 12-week modified ketogenic diet to AD patients.

I’m not overweight or obese at all, just a little curvy lol, but decided I need to keep my weight gain in check as I was diagnosed with PCOS years back. Doctor said take it easy on the sugar and the carb, ESPECIALLY the carbs. 

Keto worked and I felt like an absolute queen (my skin literally glowed??), but I was raised with a middle eastern palate and keto tastes so… bland to me. It’s also a really hard and costly diet. I have friends who eat chicken next to strawberry nuts salads for dinner - just an example. I can’t afford that luxury (also hate nuts with a passion). I’m happy to switch up my proteins, but there’s so many different expensive ingredients you need for the fake breads (psyllium husk, almond flour, xanthum gum… on and on and on….My poor student budget).

If you are in ketosis does the body not generate ketones for short term fuel usage instead of gluconeogenesis or is that only after longer term fat adaption?

Healthline had an article that basically said that sodium nitrate and nitrite don't necessarily cause cancer, only when they're cooked.

po2oy0,Wife Could Not Transition to Keto After 2 Weeks,"My wife recently decided to improve her health by transitioning to keto to see if it helped her anxiety and depression at all. She is at a healthy weight so the goal was not weight loss. Her diet before was fairly carb-heavy, but she has mostly eliminated added sugars and seed oils. She is used to intermittent fasting (16:8), which I figured would aid in the transition because she'd be more fat adapted. During the transition to keto, I suggested she not worry about fasting at all.

Since day 2, she has experienced dizziness, headaches, weakness, and muscle pain that did not improve, even slightly, after 2 weeks. The symptoms appeared to get worse after eating a meal. These are all symptoms that did not occur on a daily basis or to this extent before starting the diet. We ensured that she stayed under 20 net carbs, ate a lot of fat and a moderate amount of protein. Her staples were eggs, bacon, cheese, butter, chicken, and avocado. She used electrolyte drops, iodine drops, LMNT, salt rocks, and added salt to taste.

I had zero issues transitioning 15 months ago, and I did not even bother to supplement with electrolytes at the time. It wasn't perfect keto, but I learned as I went and kept making more improvements to my health. I healed so many health issues with this diet so I wanted the same for my wife. I tried to utilize all my knowledge to make sure her transition went well, but it was horrible for her and never got better. 

She has a close personal friend who tried multiple times to transition to keto, but always felt horrible as well. Her friend finds that she does best on merely a low-carb diet. I find so many outstanding benefits to keto that it's hard to believe that it just may not work for some people, but everyone is different.

Recommended daily calories is 1,800 but I can barely eat 1,000. I have seen some body weight redistribution and have no more inflammation. I drink 3- 17oz bottles of water a day with Propel and 1/4 tsp salt added. Before keto I could barely get one in.

My big problem is :

1) Except for the first two days and losing 4 pounds, I have consistently been the EXACT SAME WEIGHT for 5 weeks now. I do moderate cardio and weights 3-4 times a week (more than right before I started keto). 

2) During any activity I feel weak, out of breath, and light headed.

3) I can't sleep to save my life.

Help! I'm afraid if I increase my intake to perform better, since I have been maintaining my weight, that I will gain weight.

Any advice is greatly appreciated!!",keto,1

I hope this doesn’t come across as daft as it seems in my head to type out but I was wondering if there are those in the community that have tested positive for Covid-19 and would be willing to share their experiences. 

My sincere reason for asking is that over the years that I have experienced Ketosis and been low-carb, my immune system has been greatly improved. I can’t think of a single time since taking up this lifestyle that I have been floored by any virus or bacterial infection. This leads my curiosity to know how the community as a whole has been during the pandemic. 

Have you tested positive for Covid-19? Do you know anyone on a restricted carb diet that has? How was the experience? Did you recover quickly etc…

pntm7z,Keto ratio clarifications,"In the three weeks since I start keto/ IF, I have lost inches and my acanthosis nigricans has significantly disappeared. Since I’m also doing OMAD and have very little appetite, I’m not sure if the inches I’m losing are due to the fasting or keto. It feels like I should be losing a lot more pounds, so I’d like to know if some of these observations are somehow preventing weight loss because I’m not in ketosis. I yearn for the pounds melting away that so many folks speak of, but it’s not happening - although there are quite a few NSV. 

Some stats: 5’5F, SW 170, GW 135, CW 166-169 depending on the day (I don’t weigh everyday, maybe every three days.) I’ve been lifting 2-3x a week for two weeks, and started the couch to 5k program last week on days I don’t lift. 

1. I’m struggling to get my daily intake of calories due to appetite (1200 according to the calculator.) If I’m hitting 900 cal, it’s a good day. How important is it that I hit required daily calories? 

2. My ratios usually look like this: 15/20g carbs, 30-50/69g protein, and 30-50/86g fat. Does this reflect ketosis? I struggle to eat a lot of fatty things, as it makes me feel kinda gaggy. More than carbs or sugar I am craving heat (spice/ cayenne) and green leaves, which I eat fistfuls of. Protein sources are mostly salmon, chicken, eggs.

3. Since I’m doing OMAD, I worry that the insufficient calorie intake makes my body think I’m starving, and it’s holding on to the fat. I do drink a lot of water, and have added LMNT electrolytes to it. Should I be drinking anything else? I don’t like nut milks and artificial sweeteners make me gag too, so that severely limits my options.

I wanted to use keto up until I get back to 200 lbs but I’m at 241lbs now so I think I’m going to still eat low carb foods and fast but just not a lot . I’m just going to count calories even if there’s carbs but I won’t force my self to keep the numbers down . Sucks because keto was working pretty good just the anxiety that Is brought with it when electrolytes are low is so scary for me that I’d rather just stop at this point . Also I have a drinking problem so even though I’ve cut back on my drinking a lot I know there will still be days where I’m going to drink and I can’t go through this anymore .

pnok34,Posting my W's: SV &amp; NSV - and plenty of rambling,"I have a doctor's appointment next week. She hasn't seen me since March this year when I was about 263 (on their scale) - I remember feeling great and like I was looking great that day. She certainly noticed and said positive things. Then my cholesterol test results came back - but we'll discuss again after next week's draw (I'm going to insist on waiting until I stabilize my weight and stop losing before worrying about it - HDL and Trigs were GREAT).

I'm at 222.4 this morning (after working out), and am at my lowest recorded weight in about 26 years (possibly longer). I feel great, I look pretty damn good (could always look better), and I'm enjoying myself and what I what I eat. And I only miss bread when I've been drinking (which isn't too often).

**Scale Victory:** Down 72 pounds since January 7th. The lightest I can remember being since half-way through freshman year of college (93/94) was 225. I REALLY want to clear an additional 3 pounds this coming week. I'd love for the Dr's scale to read 220 or less - but it's out in the hallway and I don't think they'll let me weigh in naked. 

**Non-Scale Victory 1:** I finally tried on some pants. 

In January this year, I was busting out of 42""x30""s and had to buy a couple pairs of 44""s... Yesterday, I was able to comfortably put on several pairs of 36""x30"" *(don't make fun of my short legs)* slacks from multiple brands. In Levi's I can comfortably wear a 34""x30""... so they run big. 

I didn't buy any, because I have some left over 38's from the last time I tried to lose weight through straight exercise and CICO-ish. They will do for the next few months as I work my way down to 34's or (what would shock my entire family and a personal world record) a pair of 32's... I can not remember wearing pants smaller than 36"" - I went straight from whatever the Husky Boy's size pants I was wearing, right into a 36. Even in high-school when I was running around on field for 3 hours a day, 5 days a week, and was - briefly - 50 pounds lighter (9"" growth spurt) - I don't think I ever got down to a 34. Granted, I'm pretty sure there's been some size-creep over the decades so they're not the same 34"" - but I'll take the victory anyway once I get there.

**Non-Scale Victory 2:** I can live life happier.

A) I don't ache anymore (still) - well, in my joints, the heart's another matter.

B) Sticking to Keto just plain works. Eating right and exercising (makes me feel good and look better).

C) I think I'm very much in the place where my ""regular"" diet just looks a hell of a lot like, and happens to be, a Keto diet. It doesn't feel like much effort most days now.

D) Nine times out of ten, standing up or walking up stairs feels like I'm levitating. It's freaking wild! I hope I never get used to this feeling of just being able to move in any direction almost effortlessly. Not only do I not crackle all the time, but now I don't grunt either!

E) I'm giving up the fear. I'm not fearing food anymore. I just had an amazing Saturday where I weighed in at 223.4 (lightest in forever) and then went to a brewery, and then went out to eat, and had a great time. I drank FIVE real beers from local micro-breweries that day (whole pints even), I ate half a focaccia burger bun with my lunch because it was delicious *(shocking, I know!)* . And on Sunday I was a bit bloated, my knees crackled, and weighed in at 230, and I felt a little guilty then, and now I don't - because I'm right back on the horse (oh, I also met a horse on Saturday - long story) and I didn't end up doing the old tried-and-true, ""well that was a bad day, I'll just have some donuts today and then restart on Monday..."" nonsense that I used to do. 

I now look at carbs a lot like binge drinking. It's bound to happen now and then, I just know there's going to be a hangover (carbover?) to deal with, I'll have to go ahead and pay whatever piper comes calling, and then keep on keepin' on until it happens again - just hopefully not too soon after the last time.",keto,1

I wanted some input on my situation:
My SO and I have been doing keto on and off (a few vacation breaks) since last October. From October to April the weight was coming off slowly for us (slower for me). We were eating 25g of net carbs per day. In April my SO suggested we try a more atkins type diet that had been successful for him in the past: eating less than 10g of net carbs per day. I am losing weight (again not as fast) with this method, but I'm struggling to stick with it. This method is no copy cat keto foods (ex: keto pizza casserole), no low carb beer, no ""keto"" prepackaged snacks, no cheat days ever. And with this version, I don't have as many intense cravings for carby foods. Food is definitely emotional for me a lot of the time and I have been super stressed lately with family issues. On top of that I have PCOS, so I know low carb has to be a lifestyle in the long run.

pnhqfx,Sleep problems finally solved! (magnesium struggles),"So I started keto about 6 months ago and had huge struggles with electrolytes. I think I was deficient in magnesium before and it got worse from keto. I had been following the faq guidelines but it wasn’t so straightforward because I had bad reactions to several magnesium forms. Very long story, but eventually I started using magnesium glycinate, thinking that I was ok with that one because I didn’t get a laxative effect or weird muscle cramps. But I was having terrible sleep issues (wake up every hour or so, nightmares, heart racing, weird light sleep) and also had to supplement potassium all day and night or I would feel tired and depressed or irritable and have muscle twitching and heart palpitations. 

About a week ago I was feeling terrible and I ran out of magnesium glycinate and couldn’t get it because stores were closed for the holiday. I ended trying magnesium malate and my sleep and potassium problems immediately improved! So it’s been about a week and I’m feeling so much better! I know everyone’s different but just wanted to share that poor sleep could be a related to magnesium type. I had similar problems when I tried magnesium threonate. 

Now I’m taking 100mg of mag malate every few hours or if I feel low on it and that is working for me. I’m also getting magnesium and vitamin B IV treatment from a naturopath. 
I’ve also had chronic leg and back pain (achin, tight muscles and knee pain) for 15 years and it goes away with the mag! I spray liquid magnesium chloride on my skin a couple times a day and that also seems to help. 
Feeling so relieved, hoping the positive effects keep up and I’ll update if anything goes wrong !",keto,1
pnhg3d,Now what?,"I started Keto May, 2020.  It took almost a year to reach my goal weight and it has become a lifestyle for me at this point.  Since I've reached my goal weight April, 2021, I've lost another 10 pounds from just continuing to eat what I've been eating the past 18 months.  Question....at this point do I add more carbs or calories to my diet to maintain and not lose more?  I had a day last week where I ate more carbs than my normal 20 grams, and felt terrible so I don't think I want to add more carbs.  Do I just eat more protein and fat?  I've added fruit (strawberries) the past few months that I have every evening.  Silly question I know, but after all this time and feeling as great as I do, I don't want to ""go back"" to my sluggish, overweight self, but don't need to lose any more.",keto,1
pnhadr,NSV - Accidentally Put On the Wrong Pants,"Hello Keto Redditors. I'm usually a lurker/occasional commenter on this sub, but I wanted to share a funny story that happened to me yesterday. 

I'm down about 15 lbs, give or take as it fluctuates a bit, but yesterday morning I had a mini-breakthrough. I was trying to get dressed in the dark, as the SO was still asleep, and I grabbed the wrong pants. As I was pulling them on, I noticed they were wrong but I also noticed that they were going on without a fuss! They are a size down from my current pants and when I tried them on a couple months ago I could not get them past my thighs.

Admittedly they are still a bit tight, so I'm not wearing them out of the house just yet, but I was able to button them  without any tightness around my middle. 15 pounds doesn't feel like it's a lot, but fitting into a smaller size?? That feels so good!

It just goes to show that the weight is really not the only factor to success. Change is coming, even if it is slower than I want it (but then does it ever happen fast enough?).",keto,1

Why with our seemingly sensible approach to sugar consumption (the sugar tax on drinks) are we so backwards with our available keto range?
I suppose it's due to the more serious issues in the US? Maybe it shows the differences in the cultures, ie the US is more likely to capitalise their way out of an issue where as we're more likely to use social control/nudge theory.

I drink 1-2 cups of broth daily now, and honestly feel like at some point soon I'm going to nix coffee completely because it feels unneeded now.

I take a 100 mg magnesium glycinate with lunch.

Most days I do a 8/16 IF schedule.

I barley drink anymore because it destroys me lol but I also feel much less desire to drink which for someone with my history with booze is a welcome surprise.

Weirdly smoking weed feels different now?  Idk if anyone else has noticed this, but I'm about to go fully sober because that's when I feel best bar none.

For potassium I put 1/2 a teaspoon into my half gallon metal water bottle and sip on it for about 6 hours at which point I refill it.  I was wondering - is there anything bad about putting lite salt into a metallic container?

Anyways, I'm down 14 pounds from 190 to 176 lbs and 1.3% BF (according to my scale anyway).  Feeling better thanks I have in a looong time, I have not seen the 170s in years and with keto I was able to do it in a single month, feels crazy.

pn7l1g,I ate carbs after 9 months of ketosis to see what would happen,"Ive been on keto since December 2020. Originally, I went to an endo thinking I might have Cushings since I had horrible sleep, inability to lose weight, menstruation issues, black patches on my neck and armpits, migraines and massive hair loss. Doc did some tests to see what it could be but by looking at me he said I looked insulin resistant. Once I got home I immediately started looking into insulin resistance and stumbled on keto by accident. I started keto that week. I didn’t tell my doctor until I had a phone visit 3 months later which wasn’t wise, but he was alright with it as I had already shown some results of improvement. In those 3 months, I regained hair, I lost 16 pounds, lost my dark patches, fixed my sleep and turns out: I have had a horrible mood with constant irritation and I just thought thats who I WAS. After keto I found myself thinking clearly and happy for the first time in years. My endo was so surprised to see how much keto had done for me. I had tested high for DHEAS in the first month of my keto journey and he thought I could have PCOS but we decided to monitor that for potential changes due to keto every 6 months. Now, 9 months later, down to 135 pounds, I wanted to see what carbs would do to me. 

Over this weekend I tested carbs incrementally building up from fruit to starches to fast food and sweet desserts. Friday night I tried fruit, I didn’t feel any different. 

The next day I had potatoes with rice for lunch. INSTANT headache and fatigue after the meal. Throughout the day I felt my moodiness return as I would catch myself being unreasonably snappy at my family. For dinner, I had pasta. Again after the meal I felt exhausted and nauseous. I was also very thirsty and my temperature felt uncomfortable as I was cold And hot. My headache hadn’t left the whole day and my tinnitus, which had significantly quieted on keto, was back and blaring. I checked my weight that night and I had bloated 7 pounds. Surprise surprise: my insomnia returned that night, I couldn’t fall asleep until 4 am or so. 

The meals next day consisted of McDonalds, a butter tart, an ice cream sundae and chow mein stir fry. Needless to say, I felt horrendous. I was exhausted all day, though the sweets tasted so gooood but the feeling after was not worth it at all. I was unable to poop all weekend and I have noticed a lot of brain fog as I’m having issues remembering simple things. My armpits and neck are darker than usual and my mental is a lot worse. It’s crazy to think that one weekend of junk was enough to throw me right back. And even crazier to think that this mode of physical function is just what I thought experiencing life was LIKE pre keto. 

I’m getting back on keto tomorrow morning. The experiment was eye opening. Since I tolerated fruit alright, every once in a while I will eat some fruit. I have another appointment for new bloodwork in November to check my DHEAS levels, anything keto can affect and redos of the baseline bloodwork from he start. Overall, keto has done amazing for me and I dont think my body can handle carbohydrates.  This has been an issue my whole life (I’m 20 currently). Very happy to continue living a peaceful mentally and physically healthy life if it means cutting out carbs for good.",keto,1
pn7jex,Unpopular opinion: Keto isn't an easy -or fun- lifestyle,"I know I am gonna get a lot of push back on this. I am still on Keto because it's working for me, but the minute I reach my goal weight I am probably just gonna do CICO and maintain.

I have been on Keto since July 1st. I am down 55 pounds since then. I also do OMAD and workout 3 times a week on average. I started at 380, so I still have a long way to go. Some days I struggle with it, some days I give in; I think I have had more than half a dozen of cheat meals so far. I always felt bad afterwards: the food does not taste as good I remembered it, and I feel that I am setting myself back by having to wait for 2-3 days to get back in Ketosis. 

Still, that does not take away from the fact that I miss all the food that I grew up eating. I miss the fruits, the milk, the pizza slices and taco Tuesdays. Going out to eat with friends isn't fun anymore neither to me nor to them because I wanna keep eating keto and they wanna make sure I am accommodated for. We make it work but please don't tell me that it's super easy and super fun.

I am still doing this because it's working, but not because it's fun or easy. What helps me the most is to just focus on today. Every day I promise myself not to cheat or eat anything not Keto just for today. I don't care about tomorrow. I know I will reach my goal weight if I stick to it long enough, but sometimes I feel borderline gaslighting when people make it sound so easy. Tell people that it is kinda of not easy, and not fun, and that by sticking to it they'll feel much better health-wise, and then they can decide from there.

My husband and I both started Keto at the same time. But I'm obese and he was overweight. He quickly hit his target. The day he hit his target, he celebrated with 2 giant bowls of cinnamon toast crunch. I'm not a giant fan of cereal, but I could smell it and wanted it so bad. So there I am cutting up pork rinds, sprinkling with cinnamon and sweetener with some almond milk. It was weirdly and unexpectedly delicious!

And then the next night he order 2 Pizzas for him and our kids, knowing full well the kids wouldn't eat spicy pizza. So he ate a 15"" in 2 days.

In his defence, since then he has been doing low carb mostly and not been cheating. 

It's just really tough for me to want to keep going now that I'm doing it alone. I know keto isn't forever for me, but I really have been forcing myself to stick to it and haven't cheated or had any setbacks since I started. I just wish I wasn't doing it alone. I still have about 60 lbs to go. But I'll celebrate being under 200 and then set another goal.

I started out just removing sugar and bread/rice/pasta.

After the first 3 weeks I went full keto and cut out milk/potatos/fruits. But I wasn't strictly measuring my food or watching my macros. I had done that in the past and never enjoyed it. Basically I was hoping to hit Keto by eating in a way that I won't go over 30g of carbs in a day. Plus working out more and more to quickly burn any carbs I do consume. So every meal was 90% vegetables, with some eggs/chicken/cheese thrown on top. More recently I cut out meat as well. Lastly I also do IF and eat in a 4 hour window every day. Basically skip breakfast and lunch, only have dinner. I'm assuming that helps with Keto as well by keeping my carbs low in general, but also letting my body have more time to get into Keto before the next meal. I could be wrong. 

I'm a 34 year old 5'9"" male. My goal is to be 150 lbs. My starting weight was 220 lbs and now I'm 185 lbs. Which is exactly halfway there.

So am I doing this right? Anyone else play more loosely with Keto instead of measure every meal on a scale? Are my assumptions correct about the effects of fasting and running on a low carb diet?",keto,1

Long time lurker, first time poster, English is not my first language, sorry for the long wall of text, tldr: refer to subject, and skimp below for ingredients of my Ketoade

BP = blood pressure

Having heard some good things about the Keto diet, and seeing two alarming numbers (240 lbs/~109 kg on the scale, and 155 systolic BP on my blood pressure monitor), I bit the bullet and started my Keto journey mid-July. I lost 20 lbs in two weeks, and a bumpy downwards trend continued, and my weight as of now is 210 lbs after dinner.

At first, I had some muscle cramps in my legs occasionally, every time when that happens I drank a zero calorie sports drink to relieve it. I read the FAQ again and it suggested that people on the Keto diet should up their sodium, potassium and magnesium intake, so these two weeks I made my own Ketoade with 1 teaspoon (~5g) of reduced sodium salt and sipped it throughout the day, every day, and I no longer get any muscle cramps.

The nutrition label on the pack of salt lists the below contents per 5g serving:
1265mg Sodium
654mg Potassium
48.8mg Magnesium

Due to some issues with insurance, I need a blood pressure reading from a registered physician.

Confident in my progress, and wanted to get this over with as soon as possible, I went to the nearest clinic for a reading. Result: 175/85. Bummer. No way that could be true? With my own readings, systolic BP after dinner dropped from the 150s range to around 130-140.

It was also the first day I started sipping Ketoade, so I figured it might be due to a combination of me rushing to the clinic without sufficiently resting, white collar effect, and insufficient electrolytes causing this spike in BP.

Long story short, I went to another place for readings a few weeks later, and the systolic BP is in the 150 range, still higher than my own readings at night, and still high enough to be considered hypertension. Unfortunately, I forgot to bring my own BP monitor that day for comparison. The day after, I measured my BP throughout the day and it was again consistently within 130-140 systolic BP.

After weeks of sipping Ketoade every day, confident in my progress again, I went to a clinic which helpfully decided to take my BP first before officially admitting (and billing) me to the physician. I brought my own monitor with me and measured my BP at their door before I went in, and consistently got systolic BP readings below 140. At the clinic however, the reading was in the 170 range again. This time I asked them why there could be such a large difference within 20 minutes, and they say their monitors are more accurate since their monitors are wired, unlike my wireless monitor.

I am shocked by this revelation. Is my monitor off all along, and my blood pressure is actually higher than what I think it is? The monitor is brand new, from a reputable Japanese brand, bought only a few months ago. Or was it the white collar effect again causing the spike in readings?

pms8wd,Initial Blood Pressure Increase?,"Hi, I am doing Keto again after being very successful with it in the past. Previously, I didn't really keep track of my blood pressure however these days I do check it every few weeks, typically first thing in the morning. So today is day 7 of keto this time and my systolic is 170! My typical reading is 120-130 / 70-80 so obviously this is very concerning. I sat down for a little while to relax and took another reading and it was the same 170/80. I've never had a blood pressure reading this high in my life and am obviously pretty concerned about this. I have been supplementing my electrolytes as recommended and otherwise feel pretty good. No significant fatigue, headaches, loss of energy, anything like that. The only problem I'd say I do have is I haven't been sleeping as well. Now I know lack of sleep can cause high blood pressure, but I haven't been sleeping THAT bad and am still sleeping 7.5-8 hours most nights. I do have obstructive sleep apnea but I have a cpap treating it.

Any ideas as to why my BP might be spiked so high would be appreciated. Is this common when starting keto?",keto,1

pmnk62,Just landed into the NORMAL weight category (and just general progress all around),"Weighed in today and I'm finally in the NORMAL weight category!

&amp;#x200B;

I started at OBESE and quickly slid down to OVERWEIGHT. But in these past few weeks my weight loss seems to slow down. There was even a week where I only lost 0.2lbs. I've read that it's normal for weight loss to slow down especially if you compare it to the very rapid loss at the beginning. So I just tried to keep myself in the headspace of ""at least you're not gaining"" and ""it's okay. you can feel and see the results anyway"". And just soldier on.  

&amp;#x200B;

I've also started to incorporate more exercise into my routine. Mostly cardio (cycling and skipping rope). I've been cycling before keto but it's mostly for errands and very quick rides around town. But I've been doing it more regularly and for longer durations now. I also got myself a skipping rope for when the weather is bad and I can't cycle (it's cheaper than an indoor bike trainer). It's not my favorite exercise but I've stuck to it so far. I'm planning to start with some strength exercises too to help tone up overall. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've started needing new clothes since my current ones don't fit me right anymore. I used to prefer very snug sports bras since I am big chested and I prefer to strap my chest in place when I exercise or need to move around a lot. But now those sports bras don't feel snug anymore and just fit like normal bras. And since my normal bras are loose now, I've been using my sports bras as daily bras.

I also recently bought jeans because my old ones are loose now. I didn't know my new size so I just asked for the next size down from my usual. I had to keep asking for the next size down. Basically went from a size 12/14 and ended up getting a size 6. 

I ordered some new swimsuits and I'm looking forward to rocking them in our trip to the beach later this month! 

&amp;#x200B;

And lastly, I just feel more confident overall. I used to avoid wearing sleeveless tops because I am insecure about my arms. If I do wear tank tops or such, I always bring or wear a jacket or something to go on top. But I feel more comfortable bearing my arms now. 

I also didn't feel comfortable having my photo taken or posting my photos on social media. If ever I post anything, I'd be a selfie that's strategically angled and showing nothing from the neck down. But my camera roll has been filling up with more photos of me and some mirror selfies recently. 

&amp;#x200B;

Honestly, I thought I would only do keto to jump start my weight loss journey. While I was researching about it, I actually didn't think it was going to be sustainable for me. But here I am, about 3 months in and I really think this is something I can do long term.",keto,1

pmkaxm,I thought I was doing okay supplementing my electrolytes,". . . But I guess not. I typically put 1/4 tsp of Himalayan pink salt in my water 3x a day, magnesium calm 2x day (I break up that 1 serving into 2) and 1/4 tsp Morton lite salt 1x. A lot of the time I have deli meat for lunch and I seem to feel okay. I get about 75% at least of the amount listed in the FAQ. I knew I was a bit under but figured I felt fine.

Until today. I started to feel light headed, went on my lunch and had my ketoade. That does happen occasionally and usually it’s because I haven’t had a chance to drink my ketoade. It’s just been so busy at work lately. 

Anyways I came back from my lunch and I felt worse. I was shaking. My light headedness wouldn’t go away. I felt like there was resistance?? when I walked. (I really don’t know hot to describe it). I ended up doing 1/2 tsp of the Himalayan pink salt in 20 oz of water and then I drank a second one. I did eventually feel better, but it took hours. I really thought I was going to have to leave work and maybe I should have. I just didn’t want to leave my coworker to close alone. I guess from now one I’ll be doing 1/2 tsp in my water, especially if I’m not eating anything salty. I think that was the other problem, combined with being overtired, stressed and being super busy.

pmaimd,"A step-by-step guide to setting up the Cronometer app (free version) with your Daily Macros (Calories, Net Carbs, Fat and Protein) and Electrolyte Targets (Sodium, Potassium, Magnesium).","Hi everyone, I have been doing Keto since the beginning of June and during that time I have been using Carb Manager to track my food and macros. However the free version doesn’t let you track your electrolytes because you can’t see how many milligrams of sodium, potassium or magnesium you have consumed from your food. I therefore decided to change to Cronometer this week because I was told that its free version showed this information but also that the macro and nutritional information in Cronometer is a lot more accurate than Carb Manager because unlike Cronometer, anyone using Carb Manager can create a food entry and enter nutritional values for it without any verification.

It took me a lot of trail and error to set up the Cronometer app with my macros and electrolyte targets so I thought that it would be useful to share the step-by-step process here for anyone else who wants to get started using Cronometer.

&gt; All review comments welcomed, so let me know if I’ve made any mistakes.

**Setting up your Macros (Calorie, Net Carbs and Fat limits and your target for Protein) in Cronometer.**

1. **What are my Macros?**
If you don’t already know what your macros are then to begin with you need to work out your daily limits for Calories, Net Carbs and Fat and your daily target for Protein.

You do this using the Keto Calculator from the /r/Keto sub FAQs, which is this https://calculo.io/keto-calculator

Put in your measurements, age and gender. The recommendation from /r/keto is that if you want to lose weight then select **‘sedentary’** as your activity level, even if you do exercise for an hour or two a day. Then set your ‘Calorie Goal’ to a deficit of 15% or 20% and this will tell you how many calories, grams of fat and net carbs that you should not exceed per day and how much protein you should aim to eat. /r/keto recommends eating a max of 20g of net carbs per day in order to ensure that you are in ketosis.

2. **Step-by-Step Instructions for Setting up your Macros in Cronometer**

What you then want to do is to go to Cronometer and complete the following steps:

1. Go to Settings (bottom right corner)
2. Complete your Profile of age, sex, weight and height if you haven’t already.
3. In Settings scroll down to the ‘Targets’ section and select ‘Energy Settings’.
4. In the ‘Energy Burned’ section select the drop down beside ‘Activity Level’ and select ‘None’.
5. Next scroll down to the ‘Variable Calories Burned’ section and if they are selected, deselect ‘Include Exercise’ and ‘Thermic Effect of Food (TEF)’.
6. Next select the ‘Custom Energy Target’ radio button option in the ‘Weight Goal/Custom Energy Target’ section. Then enter the daily calorie limit that was previously calculated by the Keto Calculator in the box that says ‘kcal’ beside it. Here are two screenshots of what your Energy Settings should look like (except with your own Custom Energy Target value) https://imgur.com/gallery/5yksRS4
7. Go back to the Settings screen and select ‘Macro Target Settings’ in the ‘Targets’ section.
8. In the top right there is a drop down arrow beside the label ‘Set macros using’. Press this and change it to ‘Fixed Values’
9. Below where it say ‘Fixed Values - Set a custom target for each macronutrient target’ select the ‘grams’ radio button and then enter your values in grams for Protein, Net Carbs and Fat that you got from the Keto Calculator previously.
10. Scroll down to the ‘Tracking Carbohydrates’ section where it has a drop down beside the label ‘Tracking carbs as’, select the drop down and select ‘Net Carbs’.
11. Finally select ‘Fiber’ and ‘Sugar Alcohols’ from the list at the bottom. Here is a screenshot of what your macro settings should look like, except with your own values for Protein, Net Carbs and Fat https://imgur.com/gallery/JlW458U
12. Go back to the ‘Settings’ section and scroll down to the ‘Display’ section. Make sure that the ‘Units’ is set to ‘Calories (kcal)’.
13. Then make sure that ‘Show Energy Summary’, ‘Show Macronutrient Breakdown’ and ‘Show Highlighted Targets’ are all selected and orange. Your settings should look the same as this screenshot https://imgur.com/gallery/tC8zoyF
14. Go back to the ‘Diary’ screen and you should probably see 3 circled charts at the top of the screen that say ‘Consumed’, ‘Burned’ and ‘Remaining’ (or it will say ‘Over’ instead of ‘Remaining’ if you have exceed your daily calorie limit) with kcal values in the middle of each. The ‘Consumed’ chart is how many calories you have consumed today based on the food that you have recorded in the app. The ‘Burned’ is how many calories you have burned that day. It’s possible to record any exercise that you have performed during the day in the app as well, which will be included in this total. The ‘Remaining’ chart is how many calories you have left that you can consume that day. If it says ‘Over’ instead of ‘Remaining’ then that figure is how many calories over your daily limit you have gone. The charts look like this screenshot https://imgur.com/gallery/mhy43lM
15. Directly below the 3 charts you will see 3 small dots, with the first dot highlighted in black and the other 2 in light grey. This means that you are on the first panel but there are 2 additional panels that you can view. Press the chart area and push it to the left of the screen (like you are trying to scroll), which will bring up the next panel that shows your Macros for the day i.e. your daily consumption of Energy (Calories), Protein, Net Carbs and Fat for the day, based off the food that you have entered into the app. That looks like this screenshot but with your own values and foods https://imgur.com/gallery/6EdxHfS
16. Press any 1 of 4 Macros shown in the screen and a pop-up screen will appear showing you your consumption compared to your target and the top 4 foods that contributed to that total and the grams or calories of each. You can also see what percentage of the total each food has contributed. Here is a screenshot showing the pop-up with example figures for Protein https://imgur.com/gallery/0k7A7Ul
17. There is a button/option called ‘DAILY REPORT’ in the pop-up screen. Press it and you will be taken to a daily report for the day showing you the breakdown of your macros, electrolytes and all the other nutrients. Here are 2 screenshots showing that screen view https://imgur.com/gallery/0c9au30
18. You can then press on any of the individual ‘Macronutrients’, ‘Highlighted Targets’ or ‘Complete Nutrient Summary’ items and it will bring you to a new screen showing you the ‘Daily Target’ and ‘Max Threshold’ for the macronutrient or nutrient. It will also show you the top food sources that you have eaten that day, which have contributed to that nutrient’s total value. Here is an example screenshot showing this view for Sodium https://imgur.com/gallery/03xRZs4

**Setting up your Electrolyte Targets (Daily Consumption Targets for Sodium, Potassium and Magnesium) in Cronometer.**

1. **What are my electrolyte target values?

Now that you have started on Keto make sure that you are getting the recommended amount of electrolytes from your food and supplements (if necessary) because on a low carb diet you lose a significant amount of sodium, potassium and magnesium through your urine as your kidneys don’t retain the minerals in the way they do on a high carb diet. If you don’t get enough of these minerals then you can experience fatigue (lack of energy and tiredness) and muscle cramps, which is often referred to as Keto Flu. This is especially important if you are doing exercise because you sweat out lots of salt and sodium as well. Again you can read in more detail about this in the /r/keto FAQs.

The total recommended daily amount of electrolytes per day from food and supplements (if necessary) from /r/keto FAQs is slightly confusing because it says the following:

&gt; The suggested daily intake for sodium / potassium / magnesium are given are given by Lyle McDonald as:
&gt; - 5,000mg of sodium
&gt; - 1,000mg of potassium
&gt; - 300mg of magnesium

What this is actually meant to be saying is the following, which has been taken from the /r/ketogains [website](https://www.ketogains.com/2017/06/keto-flu-electrolyte-imbalances/):

&gt; “All these electrolytes should be preferably consumed in addition from what you get from your food; so then the TOTAL amount of electrolytes per day  would read:”
&gt; - 5000–7000 mg of sodium (not just salt)
&gt; - 3,500–4700 mg of potassium (in the form of potassium chloride or potassium sulfate)
&gt; - 400–500 mg of magnesium (preferably in the form of magnesium citrate, aspartate or glycinate)

So you might be asking where do those /r/ketogains figures come from? If you look at the RDA (Recommended Daily Allowance) for each of these electrolytes for the [US](https://www.fda.gov/food/new-nutrition-facts-label/daily-value-new-nutrition-and-supplement-facts-labels) and the [UK](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vitamins-and-minerals/others/) it is as follows for people on non-low carb diets:
- Potassium: 3,500mg UK and 4,700mg US
- Sodium: 2,300mg US and 2,400mg UK
- Magnesium: 420mg US and 300mg UK

So given those on a low carb diet need extra amounts of these electrolytes, if you add the FAQ values to the lower number between the [US](https://www.fda.gov/food/new-nutrition-facts-label/daily-value-new-nutrition-and-supplement-facts-labels) &amp; [UK](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vitamins-and-minerals/others/) RDA you would get a maximum of the following:
- Potassium: 4,500mg
- Sodium: 7,300mg
- Magnesium: 600mg

Which hits the top end of the /r/Ketogains limits. So you could start with your electrolyte levels set at the lower end of the /r/ketogains range to begin with and then if you are still feeling the effects of low electrolytes you can increase it. 

I was also told that you don’t want to go too high on potassium because it can be dangerous. 

**Symptoms of high potassium**
The symptoms of high potassium depend on the level of the mineral in your blood. You may not have any symptoms at all. But if your potassium levels are high enough to cause symptoms, you may have:
- tiredness or weakness
- a feeling of numbness or tingling
- nausea or vomiting
- trouble breathing
- chest pain
- palpitations or irregular heartbeats

In extreme cases, high potassium can cause paralysis or heart failure. If left untreated, high potassium levels can cause your heart to stop.

2. **Step-by-Step Instructions for Setting up your Electrolyte Targets in Cronometer**

In addition to telling you your daily macros (Calories, Net Carbs, Protein and Fat) Cronometer can also be set up to tell you how many milligrams of each of your electrolytes (Sodium, Potassium and Magnesium) that you have consumed each day (and how that compares to the targets that you have set for each) based on the food and supplements that you have eaten and recorded in the app.

Cronometer allows you to set individual targets for Magnesium, Sodium and Potassium, which you can then see how much you have consumed of each that day on the main page (Diary screen), based on the foods and supplements that you have entered into the app for that day.

To set the targets you do the following:
1. Press the Settings icon (bottom right)
2. Scroll down to ‘Nutrient Targets’ and select it
3. You will see a section called ‘Highlighted Nutrient Targets’ and then below that it says ‘Selected Highlighted Nutrients’, underneath which there are 8 Nutrients listed. These are the 8 nutrients and their values that will appear on your main ‘Diary’ screen. Therefore you want to change 3 of the Nutrients to be Potassium, Sodium and Magnesium. You can decide what you want the other 5 to be. Mine are set as Calcium, Vitamin C, Vitamin D, Iron and Fibre. Screenshot of ‘Nutrient Target’ screen with the ‘Highlighted Nutrient Targets’ set up https://imgur.com/gallery/AgqBM2j
4. To change the Nutrients you see just press one of them and it will present a list of all the available nutrients. Select Potassium. Then go back and change another one to Sodium and then a final one to Magnesium.
5. On the ‘Nutrient Targets’ screen select ‘Minerals’ from the ‘General’ section then scroll down to ‘Magnesium’.
6. Press both the ‘Visible’ and ‘Custom’ options beside Magnesium so that they are selected and orange.
7. In the ‘Daily Target’ box enter ‘400’ and then put ‘500’ in the ‘Max Threshold’ box. Here is a screenshot showing how it should look https://imgur.com/gallery/8Ki4rgs
8. Next scroll down to ‘Potassium’ and press both the ‘Visible’ and ‘Custom’ options so that they are selected and orange.
9. In the ‘Daily Target’ box enter ‘3,500’ and then put ‘4,700’ in the ‘Max Threshold’ box.
10. Scroll down to ‘Sodium’ and press both the ‘Visible’ and ‘Custom’ options so that they are selected and orange.
11. In the ‘Daily Target’ box enter ‘5,000’ and then put ‘7,000’ in the ‘Max Threshold’ box. Here is a screenshot showing the settings for both Potassium and Sodium https://imgur.com/gallery/3DI1oOG
12. Go back to the main ‘Diary’ screen.
13. You should probably see 3 chart circles at the top of the screen that say ‘Consumed’, ‘Burned’ and ‘Remaining’ (or it will say ‘Over’ instead of ‘Remaining’ if you have exceed your daily calorie limit) with kcal values in the middle of each. You will see 3 dots at the bottom of this with the first dot highlighted in black and the other 2 in light grey. This means that you are on the first panel but there are 2 additional ones that you can view. Press the chart area and push it to the left of the screen (like you are trying to scroll), which will bring up the next panel that shows your consumption of Energy, Fat, Protein and Net Carbs for the day based off the food that you have entered. Press and push to the left again and it will display your Nutrients, including Potassium, Sodium and Magnesium. It will show it as a % of how much of each you have consumed that day compared to the milligram targets that you previously set. Here is a screenshot showing what you should see, with your own percentages https://imgur.com/gallery/lTPokBT
14. If you press on any of the nutrients you will see how many milligrams you have consumed, what the milligram target for the day is but it will also show you which of your foods you have got the nutrient from, as well as how many milligrams it was from each food. Here is an example screenshot for the Sodium pop-up https://imgur.com/gallery/bIoQHZm

pm7nwn,Happy 3rd Anniversary to Me!,"Hello, all. I’ve been happily enjoying the keto/LCHF lifestyle since February 2018 when I started my weight-loss journey. After I lost 66 pounds, I officially started my maintenance phase in September 2018. I think I’ve been maintaining long enough to call it: this is my life, now. Forevermore. As Belinda Fettke once said - “Once you see the benefits of low carb, you can never unsee them.”

That’s not to say I don’t enjoy the heck out of all the low-carb products that have been popping up in the past 3 years. I take full advantage of the low-carb ice cream, tortillas, bread, pancake syrup, cakes, etc.  Heck, I use liquid Sucralose on the daily in my coffee and will never turn down the offer of a Coke Zero. 

I also will indulge in full on carby treats (pizza is my kryptonite!). Usually, once every couple of months or so, I will have one planned meal that is 100% from the standard American diet. Again, it’s usually pizza. Then, it’s right back to my regular eating. And Thanksgiving Day (here in the USA) is a full-on day of “eat all the food.” 

One of the key things is that I didn’t do this while in the active weight loss phase (well, except for the soda). But, although I usually keep carbs below 30, I don’t stress having “not pure” keto products. Yes, I am a IIFYM gal!

So far, (knock on wood), this lifestyle has worked great for me. But, I still worry, you know? Too many stories of people “returning to keto” continue to make me nervous; what if I fail?

Then I read this meta-analysis of people in maintenance after dieting. And - I do most of the stuff that the successful people do in these studies! So, maybe reading this article will help someone in their maintenance journey (AKA permanent lifestyle way of eating). Here it is:

https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17482631.2020.1862481

* Monetzuma's Absolute Black (100%)
* Bonajuto 90% &amp; 100%
* Taza Seriously (87%) and Wicked (95%) Dark
* Madecasse Pure Dark (92%)
* Cacaosuyo Rupa Rupa (100%)
* Lily's, 5 kinds (40-92%, probably won't test all of these)

***Any others you'd suggest?*** I'm particularly interested in ones that use sweeteners other than erythritol and stevia (which Lily's uses).

*Also, I’m always looking for collaborators for future experiments. If you’re interested in collaborating on scientifically rigorous self-experiments with low-carb foods or anything else, let me know.*

&amp;#x200B;

BTW, if anyone is interested, the bread results were really interesting. Here's a summary of the results :

* **Lowest BG impact**: UnBun UnBread
   * &lt;10% BG impact of regular white bread; &lt;50% of the next best
* **Best combination of taste &amp; impact**: Carb0naut White &amp; Kiss My Keto Golden Wheat 
   * \~25% BG impact of regular white bread
   * Very different taste &amp; texture, but both really good
* There's a large range in impact from different resistant starches.
   * No idea what's going on here, but I'm very curious. Maybe I should source/test different resistant starches and see how their BG impact varies.
* BG impact is not easy to predict from the primary ingredients or nutrition label due to not knowing the ingredient ratios. Breads with actual flour can have the same impact as ones with indigestible fibers and two breads with the same total and/or net carb count can have wildly different impact. 
   * The only way for me to know the impact of a food is to do a controlled test. 
   * For someone without diabetes, this would probably require eating a large amount, as you'd need to induce an BG rise (since an insulin spike wouldn't be measurable).

pm72oe,3 months Vegetarian Keto - All Numbers improved Including Cholesterol,"I started keto for rising BG and to lose weight. I’m vegetarian (lacto-ovo) and also had rising cholesterol. I know this is controversial in keto-land but I didn’t want to go nuts with cholesterol so I did vegetarian keto while sticking close to the USDA saturated fat recommendation. So my protein sources were primarily tofu, almond butter, cheese, real butter. Fats were olive oil, cheese, butter, and some nuts. I think this made a difference because my cholesterol numbers all improved. I don’t think keto is for everyone but if you have BG issues, low carb eating is an effective treatment. I never thought I could lose 25 pounds in general let alone in 3 months. 

Anyways just wanted to highlight that vegetarian keto can work and it can be done without raising cholesterol if that is a concern.

Hey everyone, I recently hit my weight loss goal after a year of keto and I just wanted to share my progress.

I finally decided to do something about my weight after I shot over the 100kg mark during last years lockdowns. I've always been a bigger guy, but this was by far the most I'd weighed in a long time, so after reading up as much as I could about keto and intermittent fasting I dove right in. I even bought a home gym set up so I could exercise while the gyms were all closed.

I was honestly amazed with how quickly my whole mindset to eating changed. After the keto flu had gone I found my constant craving for sugar had almost vanished entirely as well, and foods that I used to find plain and boring were actually quite tasty.

Just over a year later and I've hit my goal of 75Kg, far less than I've ever been before, and if I'm being honest, far less than I thought I'd be able to achieve.

I want to give a big thank you to the people on here too. Your constant posts of advice and success stories really spurred me on and helped me to reach my own weight loss goal :)",keto,1
plz2tz,Face sagging after weightloss (F21/5'2/SW:140/CW:122/GW:114),"Hey everybody! 

So I've been noticing that the skin under my eyes has been sagging tremendously (also super dark purple) and I am starting to have a bit of a nasalabial line on my left side. My left eyebag also sags lower than the right. 

This has obviously impacted my confidence A LOT. I pretty much always had dark circles but I could cover them with make up. Now when I use make up they show through like im not wearing any even when I cake that sh*t on like a bakery.

I've been using Loreal retinol for a couple weeks and haven't noticed any difference other than my pores being a lil tighter. I eat lots of foods with vitamin C and vitamin A (spinach &amp; bellpepper) but it makes no difference. I watch my salt, sleep, and drink a gallon of water.

My question is, will this get better on its own? Or will I look old forever? I know I'm only 21 but my eyebags are SO  noticeable and they age me quite a bit. 

Also, I really don't want to get fillers. Those are liek a last resort for me. I'm tight on money and I also have a fear of needles and really don't want any near my eye.

The more I think about it the more I realize this became a problem when I began losing rapidly. I went from 129-122 in about a month or so, and struggled a ton with having no appetite so I was eating under 800 calories.

In case it's important: I gained 20lbs in the span of 3 months and I've been losing since May.",keto,1

I set off this morning to climb Ben Nevis, the highest 'mountain' in the UK. I had a coffee and off I went. I had no breakfast because I wasn't hungry. About 30 minutes in, I realized I forgot to bring my lunch (a block of cheddar -ye olde fatty calorie bombe). 

Oh well, I thought, let's give it a go. Well... 5.5 hours later, 1400 meters ascended and descended -  2500 calories burned, I was down at my tent at sea level again. I had to force myself to eat something!!  I literally did not have any appetite at all; not during nor after my hike. I tried some bacon and cheese once back but instantly felt sick. Almost as if my body didn't want any food and preferred its stored fat. 

Felt absolutely brilliant during the walk with no lack of endurance at all. Went on a 10km walk once I was back to get rid of some excess energy. It was almost like physical activity suppresses hunger even more and gives you superpowers.I found it a truly amazing experience. And was slightly baffled by it (hence this post).

ploa3o,NSV: Couch to 817km (507 miles) cycled in 2 months!,"https://imgur.com/gallery/99AtMB9

**My Keto Weight Loss and Fitness Journey so far: Couch to 817km (507 miles) in 2 months.**

I used to be a very active person but due to ill health I hadn’t been able to exercise for the last 3 years. During the second UK lockdown from Christmas 2020 until the end of May 2021 I really went wild with eating carbs and junk food. I could see that I had put on a few stone but I was shocked when I got on the scales in May and discovered that I had actually put on 4 stone and 2 pounds (58.4lbs or 26.5kg). 

I had largely maintained a low carb diet (not Keto) from 2011 until 2020 so my aunty suggested that I give Keto a try because her and lots of her work colleagues had lost multiple stones on it. So I started Keto at the beginning of June.

Alongside this I started to go for walks by myself, building it up to 7.7 miles per day after a few weeks.

Near the end of June it was recommended to me that I could get a cheap exercise bike and take up cycling as well for a bit more rigorous exercise to help with weight  loss and to get fitter. I had never cycled for exercise before so I was a little reluctant, however I decided to give it a go and I’ve really enjoyed it. I plonk myself in front of the TV on the bike and I have tried to cycle a minimum of 5 days per week and I only cycle for 50 minutes each time. Since I started cycling on the exercise bike on 6th July 2021 I have managed to cycle 817km (507 miles) in total since then.

And as for stats, I’ve lost a total of:
- 2 stone 3 and 3/4 pounds (which is 31 and 3/4 pounds or 14.4kg) in weight
- 5 inches (12.7cm) off my waist
- 4 inches (10.2cm) off my chest, and 
- 1 inch (2.5cm) of each of my thighs

I must say though that the weight loss is primarily down to Keto, the exercise has been great in getting fitter and feeling better and I highly recommend any level of exercise to everyone for the benefits that it brings beyond weight loss. However don’t despair if you are unable to exercise because it is not a necessity for weight loss and Keto alone will shift the pounds.

Just over 3 months ago I wouldn’t have thought it was possible for me to have exercised even a little so I’m thrilled with what I have been able to achieve so far. So good luck to everyone on your own Keto weight loss and better health journeys! 🙂",keto,1

I have PCOS and insulin resistance and it's honestly insane how strict I have to be with my diet in order to lose weight. But it's so worth it!

I started keto on March 1. I have lost 98 lbs since then. I haven't cheated once. About 2 months in I also started IF 16:8. Most days now I aim for 18:6.

When I lose one more lb I will have lost 1/3 of myself. I am too private to post photos of myself, but thank you from the bottom of my heart to those of you who have posted about your progress. It has been very motivating!

I found out last month I have breast cancer. It was caught early, thankfully, at my very first mammogram. After doing a deep dive into research on the internet I am realizing what a risk factor obesity is for breast cancers. I am so thankful I've been able to lose this weight in time for hopefully an easier surgery and recovery than if I was 98 lbs heavier.

After several years of keto (and a fair amount of falling off the wagon - mostly the past year+,  f\*\*\*ing pandemic), I've had very mixed results. I also haven't had the patience to do some sort of scientific experiment where I religiously monitor electrolyte levels and try extended periods on/off the stuff and see how palpitations are affected.  

My rough, unscientific conclusion is that my palpitations fluctuate in strength (how much I feel/notice them) and frequency and I haven't found any magic way to stop them altogether.  I still take 50mg of metoprolol a day and that does seem to help a lot to at least keep them less noticeable.  I \*think\* keeping my electrolytes up can help, but I can't say they just go away for extended periods.  I am fairly confident that alcohol can make them worse, but then I've had some weeks of multiple nights of 3-4 drinks where I didn't really notice an uptick.  And anxiety/stress definitely affect it.  All in all, they seem pretty random.

plczxg,"On keto, Dr recommended low GI diet, thoughts?","Hi there, just a quick post as I didn't find an answer in the FAQ.

&amp;nbsp;

So I've been on keto for around 6 weeks now and have been doing fine and losing weight steadily. However, my doctor has highly recommended I move to a low glycemic index diet to improve some health concerns. I'm really struggling with deciding whether I should switch or not. I started keto purely for weightloss and I know the switching to the low GI diet would result in me losing weight at a slower rate but could potentially help my health concerns. On the other hand, when I look at keto benefits, there's a few people with similar health concerns who have alleviated them with keto. So I'm just really stuck. I'm happy on keto at the moment and sticking to it no problem aside from the occasional slip up so I'm hesitant to give it up. 

&amp;nbsp;

I had a look around the internet and I found two papers comparing the two and in one keto came out on top, however, in the other, keto was good in the short term but low GI won out over a longer time period. I'm just so confused and I know I'm rambling (sorry!). If anyone has any suggestions, personal experiences, or advice I would very much appreciate it. 

Thank you all in advance &lt;3",keto,1

plcpqr,100 days of keto,"Today marks 100 straight days of keto. I started off at 50g of carbs a day and worked my way down to 25 within a couple weeks so it wasn't a shock to my body.

I've gone from 170lbs to 149. It has seemed so slow but in retrospect that's a huge amount of weight for 100 days, especially for a 5'2 woman. I was previously on a low carb diet years ago (7+) and times have changed SO much. Low carb is already fairly easy if you're a meat and cheese eater but there's keto everything now. 

Craving pizza? Quest. Craving chocolate? Lily's. Ice cream? There's tons to choose from and it's all amazing(I'm waiting on Halo top to sell their white chocolate macadamia nut keto ice cream by the 10 gallon bucket, I'll be first in line). I eat all of the keto junk food(in small portions) and I'm STILL losing. 

I barely want it any more but I still eat fast food. I still eat meals with my family and I'm still able to split meals from restaurants with my husband. I can always find something to eat everywhere and it still tastes great. 

I'm preparing for skin removal soon(I've lost close to 100lbs in total in 3yrs) and I want to be at the healthiest weight possible, whatever that is for me. Currently my blood work looks great and my previous wonky blood sugar which was dipping to 50 and going up to 300 after eating has completely resolved itself. 

If you haven't made up your mind yet.. give it 100 days and you might be surprised.

I’m having to do an elimination diet for my skin so eggs and diary / whey  have to go. 

I’m susposed to cut them out for a month at a time…  I’m not a massive fan of vegetables at all so apart from meat or avocado that really was the only things mixing up my diet.

The first stone of that was in a week, while I was on annual leave, then a steady 1/2kg a week for a month or so.

What I have noticed is I seem to fluctuate or slowly creep back up when I go back to work, and only lose when I'm sat on my ass doing nothing.

I've crept back up to around 123kg, but also have recently been diagnosed as type 2 diabetic and coeliac, so I need to reinforce my weight loss mentality and get it sorted.

MFP has me at about 1650 to 1850 calories a day dependant on if I select sedentary or lightly active.

Being a mechanic I do between 14k to 20k steps a day, probably two thirds of these at work, but none register as intense or whatever on my tracker.

I also do alternating shifts so I expect my hormones are our of whack, but could anyone possibly explain a reason why I might seemingly plateau when I'm more active?

I don't think we are generally supposed to add back any exercise calories. And I have not been since I started keto in January. I have been pretty active during keto. Very physical job on my feet with some lifting. Walking on my days off. Weight loss has been great but has kinda settled at 180ish.

It makes me super hungry. Like all my muscles are sore and I just wanna eat. I've probably been doing a few hundred extra calories on these days.

I don't want to gain weight because I start exercising and get ravenous. I wouldn't mind eating enough to build a little muscle. I keep it keto and high protein. I don't wanna restrict calories too much so I feel like I'm starving and then go crazy on junk food.

r/keto has been a super helpful reference throughout the start of my keto journey and I wanted to let you all know that I appreciate all the advice you share and the motivational weight loss stories. Keto is hands down the best diet I've tried and the amount of weight I've lost really keeps me motivated.

I started in February doing 2500 calories a day and max 20 carbs. After a couple months hit my first stall and started mixing in IF 16/8 and that became my normal eating routine. When the stalling gets worse I swap to 36/8 IF and up my water intake to curb the hunger. I also started working out daily with free weights/squats in August which seemed to slow the weight loss down but it's helping reduce the flab you get with large weight loss. I take potassium and some multivitamins daily to supplement what I don't eat and 5 months in I bumped my carbs up to ~40 a day which really opens up more veggies in my diet. Most of my meals I try to make at home, casseroles with ground chicken or beef as a base. Cheese is my downfall but I've been cutting back on that quite a bit. The only thing that feels a little bit like cheating is the occasional light beer.

Hoping to hit my target weight by April but I'll be happy being under 300 by the end of the year, and honestly I'm stoked for the progress I've been able to make so far. I've been on a slow trend upward in weight since I was a kid and decided the time was right to fix the problem.

I'm advised to take hormones atm, which I will do, but for me it doesn't seem as good long term solution. Of course the gynecologist, who diagnosed that, said that losing weight is way to go too.

pkrm63,Ventinggggg,"Oh keto. How polarising you have become in my life. 

A few months back when I was about 15kg/33lbs heavier, I saw my family for the first time since starting keto. I mentioned how things went in a previous post. Basically most of my family were chill apart from my grandma and cousin who thought I was skinny enough. Cut to a few months later, basically my whole family is shitty that I’m still on keto. Food is pretty important in my family and I feel a little left out. I always have to bring my own food but just end up not eating because I feel awks eating egg salad and pork rinds in the corner. When we went out for dinner to a pub, they had one item I could eat with no substitutions and I guess they don’t sell much roast chicken because it was old and nasty af. Everything came with chips and salad that was loaded with sweet dressing. When my family want to talk to me, all they seem to wanna say is ‘you look great but you should eat some cake’ or ‘you need to slowly reintroduce carbs into your diet’. If I wanna enjoy a meal with them, I feel like I’m an inconvenience. I feel like I’m fighting a losing battle with them.

Then I started a new job and when asked why I don’t eat sugar or carbs ‘you’re skinny enough’ ‘you need to give yourself cheat days’ ‘carbs are healthy’ blah blah blah. Now I feel like I’m on the back foot at a new job as well. 

Basically I just wanna feel good and keep on keto/low carb forever. Food is such a huge part of life for most people and I feel like I’m struggling hard with the social aspects of keeping keto. Sometimes I just wanna smash a pie in my face to shut them up. 

Also, I have no friends so thanks for listening to my rant 💕

Im male and 19 years old right now. I started keto when I was about 16 or so. I weighed 280lbs at that point. I managed to get down to 210 by doing keto and playing sports. I managed to stay at that 210 area for quite a while with not too much of a struggle by staying on keto. 

But I began gaining a little weight around February/March. I got up to around 221 lbs. I suspected I was maybe eating a bit too many calories, so I started to only eat turkey and cheese and got back down to that 210. But this past month I really noticed my weight going up. About 2 weeks ago I was like 226lbs, so I started doing the same thing and really eating low amounts of calories, but I am still putting on weight. I weighed in today at 228. Its just a bit frustrating. I hate seeing that number go up, and I really don't think I am eating much at all. Around 1400 calories or so.",keto,1

for me it is more of a combination of keto and sometimes intermittent fasting. able to have my first meal at 2pm (usually because work is busy), and a second one at 7pm and can call it a day. in the morning i will sometimes have a slice of cheese or some coconut water; previously it is bulletproof cocoa.

since i am working from home, i will have some reps of pull ups of chin ups once every few hours; average 4 reps of 12 per day. getting back to running as well, currently trying 6km per day (it was my old routine, had to stop because had to go back to office) with some additional weight.

my main concern is that my arm will now hurt from the pull ups. i understand that its probably a question better to ask at /r/fitness, but just wonder if that could indicate muscle loss, and if protein powder could help (ordered 5lb, arriving soon).

So, I'm super SUPER new to keto (only been going a few days), but I really really REALLY wanna make sure I get it right, sooo I figure that I might as well ask sooner rather than later, yknow? I've used the keto calculator in the FAQ, and I just have a couple of questions :)

Okay so 

1.) if I'm transgender (mtf) should I put the gender as male or female? If it matters, I've been on hormones for about 1.5 years.

2.) Generally, I struggle to eat above around 1300-1400 calories per day (I'm about 250 lbs rn). Is that too little? Cuz the calculator puts me at like 1700 at a 20% deficit which I would struggle so hard to meet.

3.) Currently, it says for me to eat like quite a bit more protein than fat (with the calories set to 1300), although I've heard that only a moderate amount of protein should be consumed compared to fat (I know that fat contains more calories, but its still I guess a bit more than I'd expect from what I've read, although, again, I'm very very new).

pkl0oh,In and out of Keto?,"So I’ve been following a Candida-turned-Keto diet for a while now (since Xmas 2019); started out as an anti-Candida diet/cleanse that I’ve only recently learned is essentially a Keto diet. I’ve lost a ton of weight and I’m recent months have felt better than I have in years. 

But I seem to have some symptoms that appear to be Keto-related; warm flashes, sweats, head ‘flushing’, among others. 
I’ve noticed the symptoms improve if I don’t change up my diet too much; I’m very consistent with what I eat; essentially chicken, carrots and occasionally Quinoa.
I’ve introduced the Quinoa on occasion in recent weeks to try and add a ‘carb’ into the mix, and when I don’t have a lot (under 50g daily), it seems to help with energy and the temperature symptoms and I generally feel ok. If I do that too many days in a row or eat too much, I start to feel rotten again. 
Yesterday I ate a bit more than 50g of Quinoa for the second (maybe third) day in a row. 

I even introduced some Sunflower seeds as a snack in recent days because my hunger has been revved up lately. I kinda suspect I’ve taken in too much salt/sodium and disrupted the electrolyte balance. 

So essentially, what I want to know is, am I taking myself out of ketosis by eating a lot more Quinoa, resulting in a flare-up of what seem to be my ‘keto flu’ symptoms/disrupting the electrolyte balance?

I’m just confused because the last few days I’ve felt really good and now today I’m back to feeling rotten and the only things that have changed are the Quinoa and the Sunflower seeds.

Pandemic happened and I went off keto. Since 3/2020 I've gained back 75lbs, much of it muscle from heavy lifting and lots of running but definitely much of it was fat too.

I'm going back on keto, but this time I'm trying to do it a little better, a little more healthy.

pk7cuh,Keto related question regarding mesotype and activity level.,"Hey there. 

I've got a question that keeps bothering me. 

So I know that mesotypes and bodytypes is a debatable topic but let's say it has some truth behind it..

I am an endomorph, 168 cm on 64 kg. 
Roughly 15% bodyfat mostly around the hip or belly region. 

I'm satisfied with my body, I have a big chest and defined arms but I love the concept of ketogenic food plans. 

So I my question is, since I also have a high activity ( 15000 - 2000 steps a day ) paired with 3 times home training + daily push ups ( to counteract high protein consumption ) how does my body type and activity level react with the keto diet. 

Let's give you an example: 

Today I consumed - 

Calories 2260
Carb 39
Fat 145
Proteins 150

Carbs may vary a bit since some stuff I've eaten didn't show fiber. 

Most of the fat comes from nuts therefore mostly good fats. 

As it is known during high activity and the endomorph bodytype proteins are valued more than usual. I'm not an expert in keto and I couldn't find a definitive answer on Google because Im afraid that due the rather high consumption of carbs and proteins that I might not be able to get into ketosis ( lazy in keto ). 

Can someone give me advice maybe if you are also in the same situation. 

Cheers in advance",keto,1

 A keto diet is an eating plan that focuses on foods that provide a lot of healthful fats, adequate amounts of protein, and very few carbohydrates. The goal is to get more calories from fat than from carbs.                                                                                                                                                                                         

The diet works by depleting the body of its sugar reserves. As a result, it will start to break down fat for energy. This results in the production of molecules called ketones that the body uses for fuel. When the body burns fats, it can also lead to weight loss.

There are several types of keto diet, including the Standard Ketogenic Diet and the Cyclical Ketogenic Diet.

In this article, we explain the benefits of the keto diet, as well as its risks.",keto,1

I'm reading all I can in the FAQ and help section in the subreddit and also on chronometer but I think I need clarification. 

For my first week on keto I used Lose It app, which works ok and is user friendly. 
This week, after reading so many great things in the sub, I want to try chronometer (all keeping up with lose it on the side in case I really hate cronometer)

I just want to confirm: 
When setting up my goals in chronometer, I should use the keto calculator in the FAQ, not the macros offered up in chronometer, right?
Instead, I should enter them manually. 

I think the same goes for calories. If I go according to what chronometer says I'm only eating about 800 calories a day and I'm going to find that pretty impossible. Am I right or just in ""pre-keto"" mentality. I'm already struggling to keep my protein high and fat low because I'm not a huge meat/fish eater so snacking on lean meat is tough (and expensive!)

I usually eat between 1300 - 1700 calories daily, and the last few weeks or so I have been hovering around my current weight, with no drops so far.

I knew I couldn't live with my current diet at the time, which consisted mostly of carby foods, ice cream, and very few vegetables. My body was on overload, and soon I got sick every time after eating, feeling just very low energy and not able to do much. I'd need a nap after every time I ate. So I remembered what my grandmother did. I started out with Senza, counting what I ate and not worrying about carbs. I learned where my body's natural parameters are to feel good and not go hungry. And this dub helped me so much along the way. Thank you! And once I got the hang of it, I stopped using my diet tracker. And I've been steadily losing fat, the best I can tell. No scale, tracking by how my clothes fit. I've shrunk substantially, and some things that were too tight now fit slightly loose. But I think I've gone to the extreme other end of the scales, and I'm not eating enough. So I started up with Senza again, and ill see what happens. I roughly estimated that I'm eating less than 1200 cals a day, which isn't good. I'll post as I find out what the situation is.",keto,1

Then a month ago I noticed I was feeling increasingly worn out, zero energy, zero drive, fatigued with every day, so I started tracking and supplementing the usual electrolytes and incorporating regular bone broth into my routine. I also tried to start adding in regular walking thinking some movement would give me a boost.

I'm hitting at least 350-400mg bioavailable magnesium, 1500-2500 potassium, and 3000-4000mg sodium daily for the past 4 weeks if not more. I also track my zinc, B vitamin, and biotin intakes and have been supplementing those for a couple years, and I've greatly increased my Omega 3 intake. This doesn't feel like when my iron levels are too low, that always feels like breathlessness to me. 

I'm feeling worse than ever. By 3pm, on a weekend day, after just light puttering I'm ready for bed. I'm going to sleep earlier and earlier. I'm getting good quality sleep (even better than I was getting before losing weight on keto).

pj8df8,What about vacations?,"Recently spent a week in the south eastern part of the United States on vacation.  Had only been doing the keto thing for ten weeks prior, so I was a bit anxious on how things would work out.  My ad hoc adventure:

(You may not make it to the end, so what exactly do you do on vacation?)

Hotel offered free scrambled eggs and sausage, so I was able walk past everything else (cereal, biscuits, grits, potatoes, juice, etc).  I'd put 2-3 hard boiled eggs into a sealed coffee cup and placed it in the room fridge for evening snacks.

Anytime day or night, you can find a place that will make you an omelette.  Asked for potato/grit/biscuit/toast substitute, and was accommodated with a steamed vegetable like cauliflower/broccoli or a mix of both.

One evening, I got the vegetables and a small side of grits showed up with it.  Guess the kitchen staff was on autopilot, so no worries.  Told myself one teaspoon would be okay, but wound up having three tsp since the buttery taste was just too irresistible.  To my amazement, I didn't self combust or have a seizure.

At the amusement parks, we just left all together and ate outside of the facility.  Would normally have a decent sized burger - there are no small burgers in the South - with cheddar, onion, peppers, mushrooms etc sans bun.  Only once did I get a rye smile from a server who probably yelled in the kitchen ""we've got a Yank out front"" when it came to the no bun thing.  She was curious and I explained, so we had a good laugh about it.  Generous tip was forthcoming.

As for snacks, found a Walmart and grabbed things like those plastic containers with cheese and salami(?) squares, string cheese and a case of assorted flavored seltzer.  Kept a small cooler on the floor of the back seat of the car stocked with ice from the hotel.  Usually kept four cans of seltzer and a bunch of snacks in there.  Just enough for the day in case I ran into a non-keto friendly/accommodating eatery.

Steaks, chicken, pork were just ordered sans whatever starchy carbo loaded offerings supplied.  All restaurant were willing and happy to substitute for veggies - probably helped their margins on my meal LOL

Only downside to the trip was the amount of coffee I consumed.  Hotel kept three urns going 24/7 right across from the elevator, so I couldn't avert my eyes.  No way was I getting on a plane, so the 12 hour drive each way demanded caffeine.  BTW, truck stops like Pilot/Flying J have real good coffee and the gasoline prices were great.

While not second nature yet, thinking keto on the road wasn't as dramatic as I had anticipated.  So what exactly do you do on vacation?",keto,1

pj57cj,Sweet Tooth Ebbs and Buttered Rolls,"Changed my food intake 'lifestyle' roughly three months ago.  Yup, lost a little over twenty pounds, yet the battle with sweets has only recently ended.  Guess I'd be classified as a reformed chocoholic.  Eclairs, Boston Creme donuts, chocolate pudding, et al was my kryptonite.  Of course, washing it down with coffee light and sweet was a must too.  Went cold turkey for the first six weeks and got sorta kinda used to black coffee.

Couldn't believe how the cravings ended just recently.  Still not to fond of black coffee, yet a splash of heavy cream and half a packet of Truvia works for me.  Though, I'm still astounded on how a full packet of Truvia or Splenda actually tastes too sweet to me now LOL.  Friend of mine who is an espresso fanatic suggested I up my coffee game by grinding my own and up the quality of the 'dirt' I've been drinking most of my life.  Have to agree on this latter point since the lattes and cappuccinos served up by my buddy are better than most local baristas.

So what's the problem?  I still crave a buttered roll (baguette, croissant, bagel) with my coffee.  Probably more psychological than anything else, yet I can still mentally taste these wonderful combinations.  Whether from a food truck or at home with a thick slab of creamy sweet Plugra butter, the comfort food feeling goes unabated.  Stomach is grumbling just typing up this missive.  Not even the pasta and bread sandwiches I used to devour bring about this longing.

pizwmr,Down 40 pounds in 4 months.,"I have attached a before and after picture.  As you can see I had significant trunk obesity at 277 pounds.  I'm now around 237.  I had about 80 percent fat storage in the gut.  my gut was so distended it was obstructing my diaphragm.  I'm on keto 90 percent of the time but break to eat some carbs maybe every 10 days.  I eat dairy, nuts, reds, meat, fish, and Vegetables on keto with an emphasis on fish and green vegetables juju.   During this four months I spent maybe 3 weeks experimenting on a diet at 2000 calories with carbs and I didn't lose a single pound during this time.  My guess is I have some kind of insulin resistance or hormonal problems that make weight loss difficult with carbs.  I was reading when someone carries all their fat in the stomach this suggests metabolic issues.  I'm only 32.  

I work out 5 days a week with a focus on fat loss.  I lift weights at the 15-20 rep max range as this is most optimal routine on keto.  I also bike and run a lot.

I was frustrated and a beautiful lady on insanity told me to try Keto . Well I did. 3months later, 18kg lighter and I just feel happier most days.

My entire life I've been overweight/obese. I've been active too. Exercising, walking my thousands of steps, taking the steps but my body is obsessively attached to my adipose tissue and in the absence of change, I learned to love myself. I started to feel heavier, like my upbeat fat was turning to stone and weighing me down which is why I started exercising intensively. That plus my BMI was 39. Yeah BMI is a shit monitor but Jesus!

Fast forward, I have been trying desperately to lose weight for quite some time. When I got married, I gained about 80lbs over the course of a few years and have just been struggling to make it come off. I've now entered a regimen with my pcp to avoid bariatric surgery, which would be the next step and I am just not okay with that at all. I'm on a medication regimen now that includes metformin (I'm not pre diabetic or diabetic) and phentermine. My pcp thought that doing keto paired with these things would help, so here we are again. 

I've learned how to avoid keto flu, and there are SO many more products on the market now that make keto feel like it's not even that big of a lifestyle change. I stick to a higher protein/low carb version since I don't need a lot of extra fat to stay sated because of the phentermine and how it affects my hunger. 

BUT. I love fruit and its honestly the thing that makes me hate keto the most. Strawberries in particular are my favorite thing ever. I know they're lower carb than most other fruits, but does anyone have any tips/tricks to incorporate fruits (not just berries) into keto without just kicking yourself out of ketosis all the time? I'm almost thinking that if I get a craving for fruit one day to just eat it and be happy and toss my body out of ketosis for a day or two to not lose my mind, I can't imagine it would stall my progress that much.

piuifg,Has anyone here had to home isolate/quarantine while on keto?,"I am currently on isolation because I had contact with someone who turned out to be positive and symptomatic afterwards. I’m basically just stuck in my room, waiting until I am cleared to go out (usually it's 10-14 days here) Until then, I’m relying on my family to make my meals for me. 


I have 4 meals worth of food leftover in the fridge (I meal plan everything since I started keto) so I've been asking them to just reheat and they leave it on a table by my door. I brought in all the non-perishable stuff in my room so I don’t have to ask them to keep bringing me stuff. 


I am a bit worried about when my meals run out and I have to rely on them to cook for me. They still don’t really grasp what I’m doing. They know I’m on a diet and they acknowledge the physical changes but they still offer me carby and sugary food all the time with a ""you can just cheat a little"" comment. My mom is the typical mom who thinks I'm not eating enough. She added a slice of cake for dinner and some bread this morning, 


Only my younger cousin kinda understands what I'm doing so I asked her to help me with my food. She has been very helpful but is not very skilled in the kitchen. So I'll probably have to settle with variations of eggs and some sautéed veggies for the mean time.

I'm thinking of just doing dirty keto in the meantime and order food. There are a couple of restaurants in my area that have options that can pass off as keto but I'm also afraid it might slow my progress. I am almost at my goal weight and I've heard that the last few pounds are usually the hardest to lose. So I'm worried that it might be even harder if I suddenly switch to dirty keto.

pir2vk,Matcha Latte - Preferred Keto Substitutes," I began drinking matcha consistently about two years ago. My favorite daytime drink was an iced matcha latte made with whole milk and a touch of vanilla syrup. I recently went keto on a permanent basis and have difficulty getting a quality matcha experience because of keto alternatives.

I have had difficulty matching the right flavour profile to my matcha with keto substitutes. I've generally been using almond milk (unsweetened, vanilla) as well as a half-pump of sugar-free vanilla syrup. While this has been ""good enough"", it has not been as good as the non-keto versions I used to have. I recently started to buy Ippodo matcha products and wanted to make sure I was getting the best experience possible. My next step I will try is an unsweetened plain almond milk and liquid stevia to see if I can let the matcha flavour shine through a little more as I think part of the problem is the chemically taste the vanilla has in both the almond milk and sweetener.

So with that in mind, if anyone else here is into drinking matcha, can you provide feedback as to what milk and sweetener substitutes you prefer with high-quality matcha in making matcha lattes and other matcha products?

Just passionate, asking for advice, guidance, and principles. (Background...33 M, 6\`1, 175lbs - fasting for longevity and fitness, endurance training, running, swimming, cycling, hiking)

Let's do this!

So, every nutrition book I've ever read discusses carbs are fuel for the brain and a tool for longevity. (Like the 10:1 ratio of carbs to protein in the Okinawa diet in the 40s and 50s, where people live to be 100 years old more commonly.) We need a ratio of fats, carbs, and proteins... and healthy salts for homeostasis, before and after fasting. (During the feeding window, not during fasting or ketosis.)

Nutritionists! Why are so many doctors and diets telling you to eliminate carbohydrates? Carbs do not make you fat, lazy, or cause brain fog. A surplus of calories and lack of physical tasks to burn such calories causes weight gain. Carbs are fuel for fitness and the brain, carbs and calories are energy. Any triathlete, mountain climber, high altitude hiker will bring a supply of fats and carbs with them.

pigfg2,I feel like a glow stick,"So I did keto for about 8 months once the pandemic first hit. Back then I used it to combat my hypoglycemia and cut back some weight. Great success and dropped about 60lbs. 

During this first go, I started to notice that my knuckles, back, and *specifically* my ears would crack extra loud and more often. Thankfully, this would cause great satisfaction and comfort especially in my ears. My ears, when pulling on the earlobes, would make pop rock noises and then drain/feel like they were damp. However, I decided to give up keto once the NFL started last fall to drink beer (I know, I know, it was ridiculous lol). I put some weight back on and my body got stiff.

Unfortunately, my ears would not crack/pop again under any circumstances. I tried every technique and maneuver under the sun. In the following months I eventually got dizzier and dizzier with vertigo like symptoms. I could sometimes feel the fluid in my ears but chalked it up to allergies. I also had tubes in my ears as a child so I figured that might be at play. I began taking Allegra and it helped a bit.  

Flash forward to September 1, 2021, and I started my keto journey again. Within this first week, my ears began cracking again, releasing fluid and pressure when pulled on. Dizziness has been cut in half. 

Im familiar with why fluid in the ears causes vertigo, but was wondering if anyone had any information on why keto would help these symptoms? Is it merely due to keto’s anti inflammatory benefits? Has anyone had a similar experience with keto?",keto,1
pietol,PSA: modified wheat starch stalled my weight loss for 2 years,"I started keto around 4 years ago and I managed to lose around 80 lbs over the first 2 years.  I was pretty strict low-carb, trying for no more than 20g net carbs a day. One of my philosophies early on was that I wasn't going to do any ""substitute"" bread products.  At -80lbs I was pretty close to my goal weight, and decided to add ""low-carb"" tortillas and bread to my breakfast routine. I would alternate between 1 low-carb mission tortilla, or 2 slices of Aldi's 0-net carb bread.

At about the same time two other things changed: 1) I doubled my weekly exercise time, and 2) my weight loss stalled for a few months before turning into a slow but steady weight gain of around 1 lb a month (so around 24 lbs over 2 years).

For the last 18 months I *wasn't* very concerned about the weight gain. I attributed most of it to my increase in exercise (because my clothes still all fit). And, of course there was/is the pandemic that I was busy navigating with my job/marriage/kids. 

About a month ago I read some interesting posts by u/sskaye about their blood glucose response to modified wheat starch.  As a result, I removed the low-carb tortillas and bread from my daily meals (the calories were replaced by fats/proteins), and almost instantly I started to see my weight drop again. Nearly 8lbs down in 30 days... after 2 years of being stalled and gaining.

**TLDR:**  If you are having issues losing weight on keto, consider removing modified wheat starch from your meals! Thanks u/sskaye!",keto,1

I actually started doing intermittent fasting and usually I enter ketosis by day four of consecutive OMAD fasting days even though I don't track my carbs to the gram.

I guess for new people I will clarify I have Bipolar 2 Disorder and am participating in a study looking into the metabolic and psychological effects on Bipolar and Schizophrenia. So let's get to the numbers, I started this study at 336 lbs. 1 week later I was 329. 1 week after that I was 317. This keto diet is 20g of carbs or lower daily. Going into keto I had the Keto flu for one day until I went to get a poweraid zero and poured table salt into it, then mixed it up. (Was actually quite pleasant) My body looks a lot better and my face is starting to look more defined. Now for the phycologicial affects 2 weeks, It's helped a lot with my mood Stabilization. Like... A lot. My depressive
episodes used to last 1-2 weeks unmedicated and untreated. With medication and bad therapy to be honest lol, would last 4-5 days. Now with being on Keto for 2 weeks. The episodes only occur once a week for 12-14 hours no where near as severe.. Oh, also the binge eating disorder I've had since I was 8? Gone. Eliminated. Disappeared. So needless to say, so far a great success. However, most report a couple months for the final keto effects on mood Stabilization. The study will be for 4 months. But if things continue in a positive trajectory, it's definitely not out of the realm of possibility that my bipolar could go into remission. I'll post a 1 month update.

A little back story:

Back in 2012 I did keto with little tracking, just stuck to the rules, put little else thought into it, and lost 25 lbs in about 3 months. The response from friends/family was INSANE. I couldn’t go anywhere without someone saying how shocked they were at the results and how great i looked. I kept the weight off for a long time but around 2018 I started putting on weight and now am at 180(which is my absolute highest, 5’6 female age 33)


My question is- I haven’t had as much success at my later attempts. To the point where I lose faith and give up after several weeks. The two factors I’m contributing to this are age and the fact that I’m a heavy drinker. Vodka only. 

How much does alcohol hinder weight loss even if you stay in a caloric deficit and ketosis?

Today, stepped on the scale to see 286.   


I honestly wasn't sure I'd get here, from 336 fifty lbs seems so stupidly far away.   


Nothing about this has been 'clean', I wish it had. I rely more on routine than anything else, but you know what, if it's getting the job done, I'll deal with it that way. I keep reminding myself that, regardless of anything else, that losing this weight comes with a responsibility to continue to educate myself on what I CANNOT do in the future. Keto may not be the thing that I end up with for life, although it's probably the thing that would save my ass from myself, BUT, what's its giving me NOW is the space, and opportunity, to use what it does for my body and my mind, to learn about diet, and nutrition, and my willpower and weaknesses.   


There are things in life i can never return to, and never allow myself to have. I know that some people are not ok with this, and are of the opinion, 'it's not bad if you learn to have it in moderation'--those people DO NOT KNOW what it's like to be an addict to sugar. Moderation, for me, especially around sugary drinks, is simply not possible. It's like saying to a heroine user, that they can just use a 'moderate' amount and not trigger a relapse. Sugar is THAT for me. So, some foods, some drinks, are NEVER allowed back in my life. This much, at least, i've learned that i will accomplish, and i will live with.   


Goal weight is 220--that's the weight limit to learn to sky-dive. It's not 'the weight' it's not 'ideal' or what BMI numbers say i should be for my height, but it's a tangible thing i can put my brain on as a number that accomplishes something. That it's already 50lbs closer, in a third of a year, is pretty wild to think about. Maybe this time next year, i'll weigh less than i have since 8th grade, 25 years ago, AND be jumping out of a plane.

Let me give examples of what I've encountered:

* Nobody seems to be able to agree on how much to limit carbs enough to properly do keto dieting. Keto carb budgets range from 0g carbs to 50g. That's a wide range! How am I supposed to know how many carbs I can eat?

* Some sources say you should eat to meet your protein and fat macros even if you're not hungry, but other sources say not to do this. Again, which is it? If I'm not hungry, should I be eating anyway? That seems counterproductive to any diet.

* I don't know if I have to count calories. Many places say calories don't matter if I count net carbs, and other sources say I have to count carbs *and* calories. So which is it?

* Nobody can seem to make up their minds about whether or not certain foods are keto-friendly. Like peaches - some places say they are, some say they aren't. Sweet potatoes too, and pretty much any fruit that isn't avocado seems to be iffy.

* No two sources have the same carb information on a lot of foods, namely produce. If I look up how many net carbs are in 100 grams of spaghetti squash, every single thing I look at has a different number. How do I know how many carbs I'm genuinely consuming if no one else knows how many carbs are in a given food?

How do I know what information to trust? It's frustrating because all this time I think I'm totally nailing my diet and I'm obviously not if I'm not losing any weight.",keto,1

phu8kw,Help me with my 200g protein diet meal plan.,"Hey guys. So im in a really tough pickle right now nutrition wise.

Currently i must really cut down on expenses due to some crippling debt im trying to manage, so im trying lets say, get enough food for the week for under 50 pounds. (If its 60 or so works as well.)

That for some might already be a challenge, but now hear me out.

Im also 100 kg, gym begginer (2 months) and im trying to get enough protein for muscle building which after i researched it should be enough of 200g on the low end.

I also want to do recomp. Because i can do recomp and use newbie gains, and honestly my body looks pretty gross to me personally, and if i just bulk up some more, its gonna kill me. (A lot of fat on thighs and chest, man tits shit.)


So i calculated and i maintain around 3000 kcalories.
In order to recomp, lose weight and build muscle i need 200 g protein and i want to aim for a fast- moderate approach so like 2300 kcal.

Thing is, before i used to just take 160 grams of protein from shakes (3 scoop and 500 ml milk x2 ) so i dont need to worry about counting protein at all and make sure im getting enough protein (like for example very low chances i wouldnt get at least 50 g protein daily by my normal diet, but if i ate carbs predominantly it could happen). That lended me 160 grams for 1100 ish kcal.

You start to see the problem. On a mindless bulk that wouldn't be much of an issue, but on the situation im in,  1200 kcal from food only at 100 kg would 100% not be enough and would make me ravenously hungry and just ruin everything.

So my plan is to reduce the protein shake content for real food, so i make this sustainable. But it also has to be dirt cheap so i can slowly put myself back on feet financially.

That means as cool as rice is and potatoes they will cut it for my monetary needs, but not for my muscle growth.

If i lower it to 4 scoops daily thats 800 kcal for 120 g of protein, that means i must get 80 g protei daily, in 1500 kcal of cheap food (50 quid weekly)  while still feeling full and satisfied so i dont eat more.

Honestly to me the situation im in sounds terrifying and almost impossible. But i need to do it, i must.

So i came here for help, and im willing to wiggle it a bit if i can make it happen. Lets say 60 quid instead, or 2700 calories instead of 2300 if it means i can do it even if its a much slower progress.

Im 23, 192 cm, 102 kg from uk if this helps. (So uk suppliers, tesco , asda, etc.)

phqbge,PLEASE Help! Gaining not losing. Frustrated.,"I’m fairly new to keto and I’m struggling to lose a little body fat and become toned. Before keto I ate super clean with lots of veggies and I eat out 1x a month. I’m allergic to dairy and gluten. Keto seems to have changed a lot of my food wants though. I’m craving cheese big time on keto. My craving for sweets are through the roof and I’m always searching around for food, especially super salty nuts, both of which are sabotaging me big time (I can’t seem to stick to my macros). I am an emotional eater and seem to go to nuts when I’m stressed and this diet and my weight gain and lack of progress are causing my stress to go through the roof the longer I go on without positive returns. I also feel like I’m starving often and then I overeat on nuts or peanut butter. Tell me what I’m doing wrong to make this keto thing work in a healthy way (not a lot of weird food subs).
I’m 37, female, 5’6”, 130 lbs (up from 127 when I started keto a few weeks ago). I want to be lean at 117 lbs (my pre-covid weight). My macros according to the recommended calculator: 73g protein, 17g carbs, 60g fat, and 904 calories. I try to drink 64oz of water a day and carry ketoade everywhere.

phq0az,"Just under 2 months in and down 40 lbs, thoughts and questions so far","Hello to whoever is reading this. Woke up this morning and weighed myself for my weekly weigh in and I’m happy to report that I’ve officially dropped a little over 40 lbs

I started back on July 10th at my heaviest weight being 335.5 lbs. My experience so far has honestly just been all over the place, a roller coaster of emotions. Anyways I wanted to ask a few things about my diet.

Using the Macros calculator provided from this sub with my stats has always suggested above 2600 calories to maintain weight. I knew that I had to be at a deficit to lose weight so I decided very early on to just eat once a day.

I am not a cook at all so I decided to keep it really simple with just 3 organic eggs with either 2-3 bratwurst sausages or 2 beef patties with cheese and mustard. I drink quite a bit of diet Dr. Pepper and some days about 1-2 premiere protein shakes. That’s pretty much it. That usually totals anywhere from 1200-1400 calories a day which is over a 40% deficit with calories from my macro.

But that’s just with calories, with a 30-40% def it recommends 148g protein and about 92-121g of fat. I can limit the fat almost perfectly since I rarely pass 100g a day. However I am struggling bad to meet my protein mark. I average just over 100g protein a day.

I know I’m gonna have to either add or even change what I’m consuming so I wanted to know if there is any personal suggestions for some high protein/low carbs and low fat foods and drinks you use?

Also I haven’t been really working out and I think I don’t walk as much as I should be. I live in Texas and the summer heat has been blazing hot. If I were to get more active though would it be better to start adding more daily intake to my diet? I still want to be at the &gt;30% deficit

Anyways, this is my 3rd attempt at keto but this is my first time tracking macros. I’ve been enjoying it and am really starting to feel better about myself. Thank you and this sub for keeping me inspired!",keto,1

phmmjy,Getting back in the game,"So, for the most part of my life I was 250-260lb. After a divorce, stress, eating rubbish, and never really understanding what food does to your body, I ballooned to about 275lb. I am 33 and 6ft 1inch. 

My job requires annual fitness tests, which I always struggled with. So last October I made a change. I started keto properly, and over the course of 6 months I got down to 203lb in April. I had to keep adjusting my intake to keep the weightloss going. In April I began some zone 3 training to prepare for my fitness test in August. My weight stayed the same throughout training, I wasn't too fussed as the fitness training was more of a priority than the weight loss at this time. I passed with ease and it was the easiest one I'd ever done.

Now, it is the end of the summer holidays, and I've had the kids staying. I haven't eaten rubbish every day, but I have been picking the odd chocolate, biscuit, cake. This is getting worse, I've had bread, more chocolate, ice cream etc.

My weight is now 211 and I'm p*ssed off with myself. So now, right now, I am going to find my determination again and get back in the game. I've had my fun, but now it's time to get back into it before I spiral and go back to square one.

I was wondering, if I like dab a small amount of water onto the pork rinds and then put the barbecue seasoning on while still a bit damp on the outside and then leave them to dry, will the seasoning stick then, or will it just fall off?

phgpo9,"Traditional European diets include Rye, Oats, Barley etc","Hi all,  
My fiance and i have European roots; my fiance from Croatia, mine are from Scotland and England. I am influenced by Weston A. Price, and believe that we should eat the traditional foods of our culture. I have also had an obsession with sourdough bread and through Weston A. Price and personal study have come to see that Europeans included grains in their diet... and were healthy, lean and strong.

Sweden, for example, is embracing low carb. But this is not traditional. Swede's used to subsist on Rye among other grains, as did the Swiss, the Germans, the Russians etc. My own Scottish ancestors also included Rye in their diets, and in more recent centuries oats. Potato was also very common throughout Europe.  


Keto advocates suggest we cut out grains and really restrict carbs. But wouldn't it make more sense to reject industrial agriculture (white sugar and white flour) and re-embrace our traditional diets? Why should Europeans give up Rye and Potato to lose weight when they had no weight issues living on these foods 100 years ago?  


It seems to me opposition to sugar and processed food has been expanded to include all carbs. My concern is that low carb now is the low fat craze of the 1970's that's overcorrected too far.   


To sum up: I don't understand the rationale of doing something so extreme as cutting out all carbs, when traditional populations (i.e, Europeans) had grains and carbs as part of their diet for thousands of years without weight issues. So why do i need to give them in order to be healthy?",keto,1

I've also been doing some light IF, light exercises, and calorie deficit. It's been tough - I think the biggest hurdle for me is nights when I really don't feel like cooking. I've been attempting to make bigger meals that I can stretch out for a few days, so that's helped a bit! 

I've also noticed I don't really have the urge to snack like I did in the beginning. I usually have breakfast around 10am (some days noon), have a ""lunch"" (usually some veggies, cheese &amp; protein) around 4, and then dinner at 7pm. 

While I don't really crave sweets anymore, some days are harder than others. Like today for instance, went grocery shopping and walked by the ice cream. (It is soooo hot here 🥵) I had to pry myself away hahaha

But I've definitely noticed a difference though! Two weeks ago I went for my dad's birthday and wore a dress that I haven't worn in YEARS. Before Keto I was eating ""healthy"" but was still gaining weight. As soon as I cut out carbs, voila - weight was practically melting off!

On Thursday, 9/2, I didn't check my ketones in the morning, after another 22.5 hour fast and the same amount of cardio, before breaking my fast my ketones were 1.4... [Imgur](https://imgur.com/xsNeWiQ)

Awesome, they seemed to be trending in the right direction.  My diet/macros on Thursday was nearly identical to wednesday, yet when I woke up this morning my ketones were .5.... WTF!?

[Thursday MFP](https://imgur.com/mMOnJ85)

The only thing I can think of that was different was that, I took a bit more liquid Stevia sweetener and I started taking Sea Moss capsules on Thursday.

Any advice on how I can optimize my ketones and get closer to fat adapted?    
Do I need to significantly update my fat intake?

I just use the macro calc. I'm only on day four and allowed myself a few days of semi-lazy keto (under 20carbs and eyeballing other macros) to adjust
 
Now The weekend is here I'd like to use the time to focus on understanding my macros. 

Here's what the keto calculator gave me. I started at 193 and lost 3 lb of water weight this week. 

I gave myself a 20% deficit and set it to sedentary. I've looked at others with similar stats and the protein tends to be higher so I thought I would ask here. 

I know that the most important things are to stay under 20 net carbs and always hit my protein goal (And that it's okay to go over but I'm struggling going over 90 for the past few days). Also, I understand the fat not a target but rather a maximum. Did I get that right? So many things to consider in the beginning... Which is why I'm waiting to the weekend to really tackle this part of it. Trying to do macros and weighing food and work all at the same time was a little too much so I'm using in. So far, so good.
I'm not hungry and I basically kept keto flu away. That was definitely one of my goals this week! 

Any advice would be welcome!

ph3v6z,Ketosis Science Questions,"Hi All,

So it's pretty well documented that you need 50 carbs or less to reach ketosis.  My question is this though:  I've heard that your brain needs a minimum of 120 carbs a day to remain in glycolyosis throughout the day, assuming you're not exerting yourself.  I tend to clock in around 60-80 carbs a day and I weightlift heavy 6 days per week.  I am curious what my body will do with 60-80 carbs.  Does it flip-flop between glycolyosis and ketosis? If so, is that safe? I am assuming so, as I've seen a common practice in Keto and weight training where people will have 15-20 carbs an hour before lifting, and then another 15-20 carbs after.  Anyway, any help is appreciated. This has been a concept that has bugged me for years.",keto,1

pgvaoc,Exiting Cyclical Keto sharting,"I started eating oatmeal, and brown rice on a daily basis, and in that same time frame of about 1 week and a half-i have had 3 separate sharts separated by a few days each time. The first one i had no idea it even happened and shocked by finding a mess first thing in the morning. 2nd time it happened, i started to worry because i didn't feel anything again. There was no need to go, it was just a fart. It's hard to explain but it's almost like i've had no feeling in my rectum until the 3rd time which  just happened a short while ago-i had some pain in the area, and i figured it was constipation so i started jogging and jumping and drinking water, but then it happened again.  I don't believe i've necessarily been constipated since introducing carbs, in fact i'd say i've been going regularly compared to keto, with the exception of it being explosive for some reason.  Is this a common issue? I know of and have experienced the keto runs every time i get into keto and have had accidents on keto-but they are usually very watery and i feel it coming so it happened last second before arriving to the toilet-these are regular farts disguised as explosive sharts.  I sure hope this isn't a medical problem i'm going through and it will go away as my body continues to acclimate.  Outside of this issue, i don't feel any more energy, i still feel low energy and lethargic like i felt on cyclical keto-it's the reason i knew i had to stick with full time keto or go back to carbs and i chose carbs. I had been doing keto and cyclical keto for 2.5-3 years now with once a week cheat days for the past year eating anything and everything carb and sugar related on that day and this has never happened to me. I also have regularly fasted 23 hours for the past few years-i eat all my meals at once-is this bad with carbs? More info- i only eat 1/4 cup of oatmeal, and fist full of basmati brown rice. I'm bad at not eating enough veggies. Don't take fiber supplements, but took probiotics past month-but ran out b4 going back to carbs.

All the things you think you can't have while losing weight and enjoying food. The smoked flavor and time spent looking badass if front of all your neighbors just can't be beat!

Firstly, 21 M, 5'8"", SW: 155 | CW: 126 | GW: 120. Being roughly six pounds from my 'ideal weight,' things have been ramping up in their complexity.

One being budgeting. In fact, one of the main issues. Grocery trips for a single person household have been costing anywhere from 110-140$ every two weeks. I'm not in my desired career yet, so my funds are quite limited. Spending 270-300$ per month on food just doesn't seem reasonable and sustainable for me long term in respect to Keto. What are some of your approaches to grocery shopping keto, and how do you budget it?

Another issue I face is maintaining it for longer than three weeks before crossing an 'inconvenience,' that'd cause me to go off the wagon. Though these times typically last one or two days max, it's very frustrating especially since I've never been fully fat adapted and restarting just puts out that 'fire' in me. Because of this, my trainer doesn't think keto is sustainable for me long term and wants me off of it. I fear if I come off of the ""diet,"" per say, I'll go back to the old habits of mine of overeating junk, always being fatigued, poor quality sleep, overspending (on food), and moodiness/depression. 

In all, I do want to live keto for practically the rest of my life give or take, but I keep running into budgeting issues, difficult recipes, or my trainer zipping in my ear about his detest for the lifestyle.

will cutting and bulking work the same? I lost 10kg on keto before and really enjoyed eating it, but when eating in a calorie surplus for bulking, with a limited protein intake, will the extra calories be stored as fat rather than protein?

As glycogen stores are depleted, and water leaves the muscles, will this negate any effect of taking creatine?

pgo05g,"LDL High, feeling defeated","A little back story. Been fighting being overweight but frail, GERD, snoring, stomach problems, blood pressure issues, cholesterol, deteriorating mental health, and a long list of smaller issues for over 10 years. Doctors said my stomach issues were due mostly to anxiety and stress (granted my job was a bit stressful). Years later and still dealing with some of my other problems, my GP recommends Prilosec for my acid reflux even after following recommended diet and advice.

I finally just said I need to do something about this and made some changes. I first started with cutting calories and lifting weights. Was fairly happy with the early results but started to plateau in muscle strength and fat loss. Convinced myself that being muscular (toned at best haha) wasn't going to be a name I was ever associated with LOL and pretty much gave up on weight lifting. I ate at a more maintenance level of calorie and stayed at pretty much the same weight for years. My reduced weight seemed to make a fair difference in all of my problems and I was pretty happy with it. I noticed that it was very easy for me to fall off the ""wagon"" though and often had to reduce my calorie consumption to get back where I was. Reducing calories works for me but only in short cycles because I feel like crap and always feel hungry. So I look around a bit more for something sustainable but keeps me feeling full and I discover Keto.

Before I started keto my BP and Cholesterol were in the mid to high range and mostly stayed there. My current Doctor however is concerned because as I get older those numbers were increasing slightly even with keto. This past year I have done a ton of cardio and it looks like my BP is great (YAY) but my cholesterol looks about the same as last year. Literally my cholesterol is the only thing my Doctor is concerned with. This whole process has been exhausting for me because it feels like the goal is always further ahead than I can get.

I feel better, I look better, and to be honest I'd be fine if a Doctor wasn't telling me I'm going to need medication for something I don't even know is a concern. 

**Should I get a 2nd opinion or some different blood work?**

I'm not expecting any real answers here, I think I just needed to vent. Thank you all in advance.

pgm5dm,Knocked down two goals in one with keto,"I started approximately 1.5 months ago slowly cutting carbs then 15 days into it decided to eventually cut out carbs altogether(20g macro). Up to that point I’ve been a 6-pack-a-day kinda guy, after work then I get hungry when I drink so I would order ubereats or warm up an insta lunch. 

Keto diet made me really conscious about what I ate and put a deep understanding of nutrition and macros, and we’ll ive learned the discipline of counting every carb and measuring every macro. I used to get 70-80g of carbs alone just from beer a day and my maximum weight went up to 255. I had to cut out the beer and it was so much easier with maintaining the diet being my motivating factor through life the last couple of months. Replacing drinking with going to the gym. 

Two addictions of mine are under control for what feels like the first time in 2 years and i couldn’t be happier. I only lost 25 lbs so far but my energy, mood, and happiness are metrics that are immeasurably improved

When I take in more potassium, I need less sodium intake (5ga day or less). More than that and my bp rises.




If I take in less potassium, my body holds less sodium(I need to add extra sodium) and my BP doesn’t rise as easily.

When I take in less potassium, my body needs more sodium (5-7g+) and I never have BP issues.

pggydx,New landmark study says replacing table salt with reduced-sodium ‘salt substitute’ potassium chloride could prevent millions of deaths per year.,"Hi all, I thought it was worth sharing this information given that Keto encourages taking lots of extra salt/sodium.

“High sodium intake and low levels of potassium intake are widespread, and both are linked to high blood pressure and greater risks of stroke, heart disease and premature death.”

“The link between too much salt in your diet and raised blood pressure is well established, and we know that high blood pressure increases the risk of cardiovascular disease. What we didn’t know, before this study, was the measurable health impacts on cardiovascular disease events such as strokes and heart disease of switching out traditional table salt for a reduced-sodium, added-potassium alternative.”

""Our work shows that using a reduced-sodium, added-potassium salt substitute for cooking and seasoning food can have a quantifiable impact on health, and may help to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease events and premature deaths.”

Salt Substitute and Stroke Study

The Salt Substitute and Stroke Study enrolled 21,000 adults with either a history of stroke or poorly controlled blood pressure from 600 villages in rural areas of five provinces in China - Hebei, Liaoning, Ningxia, Shanxi and Shaanxi between April 2014 and January 2015.

Participants in intervention villages were provided with enough salt substitute to cover all household cooking and food preservation requirements – about 20g per person per day – free-of-charge. Those in the other villages continued using regular salt.

During an average follow up of almost five years, more than 3,000 people had a stroke. For those using the salt substitute, researchers found that stroke risk was reduced by 14 percent, total cardiovascular events (strokes and heart attacks combined) by 13 percent, and premature death by 12 percent.

This has been one of the best journeys to weight loss and fat loss and muscle growth and everything under the sun that I’ve ever been on. I remember the first day that I decided to start keto and I recall the feeling I felt and how I felt with my body and knew it was time for a change. I am so glad I made that change. I used to fantasize about being a healthier version for myself and myself only and now that I AM that… it’s just unreal. And I’m so very proud. 

I do have to say I’m a bit younger so I’m able to shed the weight faster, and also implement exercise ~5 days a week, but even just starting small like changing your diet is so crucial and such an amazing step to make. The beauty of keto is it gives you so much while taking so little… the only con is have to say is waking up having to pee absolute buckets 😎

For everyone out there questioning if this is for them or for those who wanna give up cause they aren’t seeing results or all those in between… you can do it. I know you can. The other millions of us in this sun know you can too. Want this for yourself. Your future will thank you so much later.

One thing I noticed as I got into my mid 30s was a lack of energy.  After trying a lot of stuff like tai chi, Qi Gong and various supplements and vitamins, I decided to go keto.  The main reason I decided to go keto  was because of my experience with fasting and how I felt  so invigorated while doing so.   I’ve also been addicted to sugar for the majority of my life. I am the guy who will taste a tiny little bit of sugar and immediately destroy the whole bag.  I used to eat sugar at night until I would crash.  Ice cream, cakes, candy. Once I tasted it, it seemed impossible to stop. 

      I have been doing keto like I do everything else, rigidly for a month now.  I must say that my energy level is better and most importantly I have no cravings for sugar. It’s easier for me to fast than it has ever been. I keep my steaks and oil‘s all high in omega-3‘s in low in omega six’s.

pg73q0,"Severe mitochondrial disease with reliance on glycolysis, nearly comatose on keto","I'm a published biomedical researcher and expert on mitochondria, so please don't give me any of your suppositions that are for regular people. All has been attempted. Questions are fine!

&amp;#x200B;

I have tried keto about 11 times. It usually does nothing, even fasting. I'm 275 from steroids, and it won't lose, because mitochondria are necessary for burning fat through beta-oxidation. Instead of my body burning the excess fat, I'll simply be unconscious for 20+ hours per day. This last time, muscles were destroyed and turned into glucose. I went into kidney failure from the rhabdomyolysis.   


I've worked really hard to be able to go into ketosis from exercise, but the reliance on glycolysis at the end of the day after the gym is life-threatening now too. 

&amp;#x200B;

It seems I won't really lose weight with keto or fasting, or with exercise and intermittent fasting. The lack of weight loss is indicative of my severe energy disorder. It's really dangerous, but the only cure for my disease is to replace old, damaged mitochondria with wild-type, through caloric restriction and exercise. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm about to undergo total fasting with only bone broth in the morning to absorb my medications, with my usual exercise which is competitive swimming and triathlon training 2+ hours per day. I cannot burn fat with anything less. If my mitochondria cannot burn the fat, I will end up in the ICU again on a sugar drip. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I do this fast (maybe 60 days or so), my mitochondria will have to burn the fat or else I will die, which is a real possibility, but with anything less than this extreme, they wait for sugar, or dietary fats instead of inducing lipolysis. My body will do whatever it can to reduce energy expenditure to save my life. But it's also paradoxically ending my life. I've activated the ability to enter ketosis with a PPAR-alpha agonist, and I will fast with thyroid hormone which is downregulated in starvation.

All of my attempts have been a failure (stevia, Splenda, etc.), so much so, a couple of years ago I finally acquired a taste for whiskey neat. Nevertheless, I missed making a cocktail or two for the wifey and I. Now all of that has changed, this is one of the best substitutes I’ve tried.

How are you all doing ?

It's been a long time since I got here,and it's because I stopped my keto diet..

And I'm not very happy about it.

&amp;#x200B;

I stopped because I was struggling with my depression,and because of the covid,I would be home all day for the whole week,and that really messed up with me physically and mentally.. Since I couldn't eat vegetables,I didn't have a lot of food choices.. I would always want to eat (not hungry) because I was always bored ,and I would always cheat and mess up my diet..

But now I'm feeling better ! \^\^ And school is starting soon so I've been thinking about switching my diet to keto again !

But I've been hearing a lot of warning about this diet..

I am very young, I am 15years old, I'm 4""10 (148cm), and 123 pounds (56kg).

And I know that at this age,I need to consume a lot of nutriments to grow normally..µ

&amp;#x200B;

But I really want to lose weight..

I tried other diets,but keto seemed the only one that would discipline me,and the only one that would work. And the gym is closed because of covid.. I also have a lot of trouble eating vegetables,but I'm starting to learn more about the ones that I like and the ones that I don't.

&amp;#x200B;

I know that a lot of experienced people are in this community,so please can you tell me if starting keto again is a good idea or not ?

I am really lost between taking care of my health and losing weight..

Do you guys recommend getting lakanto or pure monk fruit? Lakanto certainly seems easier, as a lot of popular recipes reference it directly + it's easier to find out how much you need due to the 1:1.

Is the taste better with Lakanto or pure monk fruit?

Also, does anyone know if it dissolves in drinks well? Or should I just get liquid monkfruit drops for my tea?

Sugar cravings can be difficult to overcome but intermittent fasting can help. When one begins fasting for the day, the hunger-suppressing hormone leptin levels initially increase, appetite decreases and sweet tooth desires lessen. 

When one stays in a fasted state for a long period, leptin levels start to drop. This may cause feelings of increased hunger and desires for sugar the first couple of weeks. As leptin levels normalize, hunger and sugar cravings subside and in time the sugar craving cycle can be broken.

I'm curious if a person who has spent one month on keto with the majority of days under 1000 calories can suddenly have extreme hunger after one day at above average calorie intake? Approximately 1900 calories yesterday. High protein and I'm nearly positive my carbs are exactly 20g (which I've always been ok at) 



I'm dialing back to 18g carbs and limiting take out to make sure I'm accurate but I used nutrition pdfs so I'm pretty certain carbs aren't the culprit.

My question is, what else in these protein powders might inhibit ketosis?  Is there one that's better to use than others? What do you recommend?

2. I enjoy drinking a Bang energy drink from time to time. They advertise 0 carbs however, is anyone aware of other ingredients in Bang that would inhibit ketosis? If so, is there another energy drink option that doesn't screw with ketosis?

pf4led,Bummed out on KETO &amp; IF,"71 yo F, 5'5"", sedentary SW 228#/ CW 170# GW, IDK maybe another 20-25# or whatever gets me into a size 6 

I've been on 18:6 IF and keto for 8-1/2 months. For the first 3-4 months, I felt like superman. Lately joint pain has recurred and it is getting worse. I was doing a 25% caloric deficit but recently switched to 20%. - I intentionally didn't adjust macros to account for my last 10 lbs loss. Calorie limit is &lt;1150 which is low enough. Protein is 75g/ carbs 18g/ fat 85g- I often exceed my protein. I am in no great hurry to lose the last 20# which is good bc it's been pretty slow lately. I also hope the lower calorie deficit will slow hair loss &amp; get my energy levels back up to prior levels, but my main concern is joint pain/inflammation.

I do super-low carb, &lt;20g/day but usually end up &lt;10. I have added **occasional** crap like aspartame-sweetened &amp; artificially colored sodas &amp; jello as well as **daily** commercial keto ice cream (Enlightened &amp; Rebel), as well as a good amount of 'deli ham'. I probably don't consume enough veggies or water (I try) and mostly eat lots of eggs, nuts, protein shakes cheese &amp; meat. Lots &amp; lots of cold-brewed black coffee. I only use coconut or olive oil. Home-prepared desserts &amp; shakes are sweetened with erythritol/monkfruit. I take collagen &amp; vitamin/mineral supplements &amp; have no food allergies &amp; take no Rx drugs except for a rare Tramadol when the pain is very bad.

Is it possible artificial sweeteners/colorings are causing increased joint pain? Or am I going too low on carbs? I plan to lay off the crap for a while and see if that's the culprit, but also wondering if anyone here has similar experience of positive effects (especially inflammation) taking a U-turn.",keto,1

This was my go to with a diet limeade if i was craving fast-food/burger.

pei2im,Women on Keto,"TLDR:  Don’t you give up now.  You are farther than you think.  Changes are not always measurable on the scale.

Hey all. I am 5’4” 32F.  Started keto in February at about 137lb.  I am now at 143lb.  The reason I am sharing my story is so that other people who are starting this lifestyle, especially women, can understand that not all of the benefits are illustrated by numbers like your weight.  In addition to eating low carb, I also do IF (intermittent fasting) and near-daily exercise (lifting weights).  I’m obviously heavier now than when I started, but I can truly say that my body composition is significantly different, and I am liking both the way I look and feel.  

I started keto to support my spouse whose goal was mainly weight loss/fat loss.  After about 4-5 weeks my spouse had dropped significant weight.  He was looking great and feeling great.  That lean, high energy, finally-clean-from-carbs feeling had hit.  I was feeling better too but when I stepped on the scale or looked in the mirror there were no obvious changes. 

I kept thinking my big milestone was just another week or two away.  Soon I was going to be dropping big numbers like my spouse.  Soon I would be “Fat-Adapted” and the smart scale wouldn’t even recognize me because my weight change was so significant.

Ladies, let me just say, I have NEVER had that moment. I have not had any crazy back-to-back weeks of shedding pounds.  But I am still here, still doing keto, still going strong, still thinking about Taco Bell every day but eating cheese sticks instead.  You know what I am not doing?  Riding a rollercoaster of fad diets, feeling guilty about eating the “wrong” foods all the time, having mid-afternoon sugar crashes, or talking my spouse into or out of ice cream every weekend.  What keeps me on keto is how SIMPLE it is to execute, and how CONSISTENT it keeps me.

Even though I haven’t lost weight or met some metric typically used to measure diet success, I feel awesome.  I feel good.  My clothes fit better, I have more energy, I worry less about meals altogether.  I know my body fat has gone down because my muscles have become more defined.  It’s not always just about losing weight.  Keto can be about getting structure in your life, or learning more about what makes these awesome bodies of ours work, or testing the limits of your discipline and mental toughness.

So if you are out there struggling or about to give up PLEASE DON’T!  I hope I have helped you find some benefits to keto that can’t be quantified.  Just because you saw a success story where somebody has already lost 25 pounds and they’re only on week 10 does NOT mean you have not been successful.  Everybody’s goals and bodies are unique.  As much as we should (and I seriously do) applaud how far others have come on their keto journey, we should give ourselves credit for how far we have come on our own journeys.  You are farther than you think!",keto,1
pehp0i,Clean or Dirty,"Question for those who have been successful on Keto.  Did you go with clean keto or dirty?  I'm just starting out (sort of--tried it briefly a few years ago); can't lie, the idea of eating bacon and steak everyday is pretty appealing.  But I watched some videos from Thomas DeLauer, and he's saying I need to eat lean cuts of meat with healthy fats added such as avocado.

peg2o2,Any no fridge egg recipes? I need ideas,"Hi everyone. Weird problem, but I thought I'd throw it out to this awesome community. I live alone and for various reasons I find myself in a very strict lockdown without a working fridge. It will be weeks until I can sort this problem out and going to the supermarket is difficult. After trying a few things I've just decided to base my food mainly on eggs. I buy fresh free range eggs locally which last weeks outside the fridge.

This seems okay for now, but without bread as a base a meal of eggs feels very lacking and samey (yes, I boil, fry and scramble but still). Like a nice steak with eggs works great, but I can only get to the store every few days, so what do I do in between? I am doing some IF and straight fasts also.

So, I'm looking for ideas for shelf stable additions for eggs (obviously Keto). Stuff to add that will change it up or other recipe ideas would be great! Any suggestions would be much appreciated since I'm feeling very stuck at the moment.

I'm adding misc other stuff around when I can go to the supermarket. But nothing lasts and doesn't come in small enough sizes. Like cheese is minimum 250 grams (8 ounces) and after opening the package it will only look okay for a couple days, so kind of a rush. Nuts are great too, but need to limit carbs and all.

pefzka,Two Weeks and 9 Pounds down,"Hey everyone,

I recently got engaged and committed to losing weight for the wedding (if there even will be one at this point thanks Covid), and I remembered the lowest adult weight I've ever been was during my last serious stretch on keto.

I'm now two weeks into it and am down from 190.9 pounds to 181.7 this morning as a 5'9 30 year old man.

More importantly though, and this is the real reason I'm going to stay keto, is that my acid reflux is pretty much gone.  Up until two weeks ago I had been taking OTC Prilosec or popping tums like candy when needed.  Over the past two weeks I only needed Tums once and that was when I tried a Halo top.  But tbh I barely feel like I miss sweets anymore.

Currently I don't count calories, just carbs.  But in another week or two that will probably change.  I definitely am able to get by much better on less food and overall feel way less hungry.  I can't finish a 3 egg omelette anymore.

My meals are pretty basic.  I eat a lot of salads for lunches with a fatty dressing, cheese, protein, and all the veggies I want within carb limits.

Dinner, I usually make a square meal for my fiance but I just skip the carb and double my vegetable portion (adding butter and cheese).

One benefit I don't recall from my last serious stretch is that I feel like I am sleeping much better now.  I feel more refreshed waking up.  Idk if that's just coincidence but it's a nice benefit.  Not to mention, I had started getting this thing where I'd wake up in the middle of the night and a finger or part of my hand would be numb, but that has since completely disappeared since keto.

Right now my goal is just to see 179.9 on the scale, something I haven't seen in years.  I probably have not seen 181 on the scale in about a year, so seeing myself get there in just two weeks is pretty mind blowing.

The difference between this go around and previous ""false start"" attempts at keto is I'm taking potassium very seriously.  I have one of those half gallon water bottles I add 1/2 a tspoon of the lite salt to, and I drink two of those a day for 1500 mg potassium over the course of the day.  Then as long as I salt my lunch/dinner with 1/4 a tsp lite salt each I'm at 2200 mg potassium and usually my food takes me to 3,000 potassium for the day.

Idk what else to say.  I feel great.  I feel optimistic.  I feel like I can think clearer.  And I'm feeling like I want to quit smoking weed because I am want to see how healthy I can be, it feels good.  I've already basically quit drinking as alcohol ruins me the next day (and that was before keto, just a byproduct of turning 30).

I haven't started or done any exercising yet, just trying to get my steps most (but not all) days.  I think after another week or so of keto I'm going to start working out again.  Anyways cheers folks.",keto,1

pedv0n,Keto/low carb may have caused diabetes for me,"Hi all, here goes my story

Have been on keto and mainly low/carb for the last 3 years. Started off strict keto for 6 months, then moved to low car (around 100gr carbs). For the first two years managed to loose 60lb and then maintained weight for a year. Been happy and had no complaints whatsoever. Was not lean, but in good shape with leftover belly fat, This summer decided to get a beach body and lower body fat and do keto again. Also started some lightweight HIIT daily. One month into it, i started having slightly elevated BP readings, started having trouble seeping and waking up at 2am with panic attacks and then multiple times at night to visit the restroom. After a regular keto meal i would get burning sensation in my head. A quick blood work revelated elevated fasting blood sugar and low insulin. the doctor i visited said i most likely have  type 2 diabetes and scheduled me for glucose tolerance test which i am to do next week. He believes the ketogenic lifestyle has caused this. Interestingly, when i add more carbs all symptoms go away, i am able to sleep at night without waking up, no blood pressure etc, but i feel i am gaining belly fat even though i am eating in a caloric deficit. If i have say an omelette lunch, i start experiencing strange sensations, elevated stress levels, shivering in the hadns, chest congestion. And when this is followed by a keto dinner, then i would most definitely get up at least 3 times to go to the restroom.

Any advise is welcome, i am a bit scared because i liked my lifestyle on keto, liked the way i feel on it and the results i achieved.

for the record, i have had no serious highly stressful situations recently, been managing and coping with daily stress fairly ok.",keto,1

Last year I did lazy keto and was very successful and lost 40 pounds. In the last 6 months I’ve been practically in a binge, and I’m pretty sure I’ve gained all of it back. I have failed going back on keto several times, but now I’m ready to claw and gouge my way to a healthy weight.

My self esteem took a huge toll with weight gain and my depression plummeted. I’m over it. I’m ready to go back to confidence and radiance, and I’m ready to do keto the right way too by tracking electrolytes and other nutrients. Per the FAQ, I bought salt and no salt for ketorade and it says to sip it because it’s dangerous to drink it too fast with the potassium. I drink water like I’ve been deprived of it for days; how slow do I have to drink ketorade?

As an accountability post, I just want to throw out my goals. The first one is to find stomach relief (I had my gallbladder taken out 5 years ago and have had diarrhea daily ever since), and the second is to try to model.

pdxjl4,Time to get back on the horse,"4 years ago, at 28 and after watching this thread for a few months, I took the plunge with both feet - aggressively - with a 60% deficit and 30min walks everyday at work (since I wasn't eating lunch anyway and quickly adapted to a 20-4 IF schedule with 15g net carbs/day) , in an effort to lose some weight and help my wife keep weight gain to a minimum while being pregnant with our 2nd son.

I started at 315 and over 6 months got down to 265. I was elated. Then we had our second kid; and the never sleeping and all that broke my streak.

since then we've had another son, 3 boys total, a pandemic, my wife's 20 year brother died, we got a english mastiff puppy to help cope with that loss and he is pure chaos but super cute and my wife's anxiety and depression is at an all time high. though that I've been slowly building back up, now well past my SW of 315 and closer to 350. I've tried Keto again a few times, trying to hop right back in to where I was, 1200kcal/OMAD/5gNetCarbs and trying to kick my caffeine addiction (WakeUp pills 2x400mg a day), and obviously haven't made it very far (I also got my NCarbs wrong, I thought I was doing 5, but looks back at my notes is was 15g the whole time, dunno where I got 5g from...)

I'm not diagnosed with anything yet, but I feel like I'm getting too old to avoid Diabetes and HighBP and really dying.. a lot of midsection fat, and a family history of heart problems for much longer.

now I'm sitting at 32, 6'6"", 350lbs, 40% bodyfat - cutting back to a 40% deficit (1800kcal to start) 15C/170P/115F macros and time to start walking again; I have 3 boys at 6yo, a 4yo, and a 2yo and I want to be able to run around with them and play.

goal #1\] I really want to be able to bend over and tie up normal shoes without holding my breath.

wish me luck.",keto,1

Waitress misunderstood and asked for it made without “butter.” She put down my wrong omelette, laughed about it, and walked off. I tried eating a bite of it, but I swear it tasted like raw flour. Maybe I’m imagining it. (She said it was my fault she misunderstood and I should have asked for “shell eggs.”)

Has anyone had this happen before? Do you notice the flour flavor? I didn’t eat it and had it removed from the bill when she finally returned. I did not ask for it to be remade because after she laughed and walked away, we didn’t see her again until she dropped off the bill.",keto,1

pdws2r,WHY DIDN'T I DO THIS SOONER???,"I used to make fun of ""fad"" diets and pretty much all dieting. I have always and still do HATE working out for the sake of working out. But I love working hard at a job or at hobbies. I ate what I wanted and was pretty alright since I kept active enough to look okay. At the beginning of the year, I was 200lb as a 5'9"" trans woman. Then I started working at Walmart, and without changing diet I dropped to 175 in 4 months and hit a plateau there, just from all the walking and lifting I do at work. But losing that weight excited me and I started looking for ways to keep going past 175. So here I am!

I've been eating 1400 calories a day and keeping my carbs under 30 for about 2 weeks. I thought I'd be miserable, but I LOVE it. Sure I miss Dr Pepper and pasta, but I make up for that with wonderful black coffee and bacon, and the rest came pretty easy. I've felt great every single day so far. No hunger pangs, no feeling weak like I used to when I skipped a meal, very minimal side effects, and I've already lost 5 pounds in 2 weeks!

My initial goal was 160, but now I may shoot for my college freshman weight of 145. How do you decide when to stop, and how do you taper off or set a regular diet to maintain once you get to your goal? Or do you just keep going and you'll stop when your body is ready to stop?",keto,1

pdt412,Guys I have to show you this - the easiest and fastest way to make mayo,"My boyfriend LOVES mayo but I never liked the ingredients or the price of those store-bought mayo jars. I made mayo a couple of times but it was too complicated: one raw egg, one boiled egg, mix slowly, cast a spell on it, etc. So I searched a recipe and I found THE EASIEST way to make it. It literally takes one minute and I filmed myself to prove it.  

I found the recipe on TastesLovely which belongs to a genius American woman. I take no credit. 

The first batch I made I used the exact ingredients, but it came out a bit stiff so the second time I adapted them: 300g oil, 1 large raw egg, lemon, salt, mustard, pinch of black pepper and a bit of garlic powder. If you want it runny, I guess you could increase the oil quantity. You also need a handheld mixing device(I don't know the English name) and a pro tip from her blog: Find a jar or a container just big enough for the mixing wand - that way you can store the mayo in the same container and have less stuff to wash. Also, make sure you place the mixing wand head on the egg yolk before you start it. 

I don't know how to upload the video here so I guess I'll just leave a link. Please do make it and tell me how it went. I was astonished how easy it is.

And then I got pregnant (probably because all the inflammation and weight dropping caused my ovaries to work correctly.) I was gestational diabetic and the medication regimen they had me on I had to eat carbs to keep my blood sugar from dropping too drastically. I also live in an area where most doctors are not keen on keto. After I had my sweet boy, I stress ate. I had postpartum bad. Pretty sure the first couple month after he was born I lived on Coke Zero and chocolate. I was just surviving. That was in late 2018 to early 2019. A family tragedy happened. My depression became worse. Covid lockdown. Anyway. I gained back any and all the weight I had successfully dropped.

Started keto anew today.  I was gonna do IF but I have a household of sick folks right now and lost track of time so I ate outside my window. It's cool though, I'll  get it right tomorrow.

I'm glad I found this community. I've been taking notes in between taking care of my family. I am excited to start this journey again. I don't even mind I have to give away my new pint of pineapple sherbet. I will survive. ;)

pdgewf,Blew up on long bike ride,"Just a warning that this post includes me eating carbs. If this triggers you, don’t read. Also TL;DR is at the end. 

2 years ago I was doing great eating keto and riding my bike lot. I built up slowly to handle a century ride using keto fuel, such as UCAN powder, electrolyte tabs, and f-bomb peanut butter packets. 

During COVID I fell off keto. No excuses, but here we are. About 6 weeks ago my wife and I started riding our bikes in preparation for a century in early October. This was all done on carbs until a few weeks ago when I hopped back on the keto bandwagon. I’ve felt awesome the last 2 weeks - weight was down, my head feels clearer, and I’ve been lifting weights and doing shorter bike rides on the trainer (1-2 hours) with no issues. 

Today we decided to do a metric century, which is 62 miles. I had my UCAN powder, electrolyte tabs, and a fathead bagel to eat at the halfway point. I had a pretty big keto breakfast before we headed out. 

The ride started out fine, then I started to feel a bit weak at mile 30. We stopped for 20 minutes or so, I ate the fathead bagel and we continued on. 

At mile 40 I blew up. I bonked hard, I hit the bottom of the barrel. I usually average 17-18 mph on the bike. I was doing 5 mph and feeling like death. If you’ve never truly bonked out in the middle of nowhere, you have no idea how scary it can be. 

Anyway, a few miles down the road my wife was waiting for me at a turn off. There was a 7-11. Dear Lord I was saved. 

Carb eating trigger warning ahead. 

I ate a turkey sub, a box of precut watermelon, and downed a 16 oz Coke. It was truly the only thing that was going to get me back home. I also bought a second Coke and a bag of gummy bears to stick in my pocket as extra fuel. I ate/drank them at another stop on the way back. 

So what about all this? Does this mean keto doesn’t work for long rides? No, I think it can. But I it takes a lot more time than 2 weeks to get fat adapted. If you’re an endurance athlete switching to keto, take it easy and build up your mileage. Bring some emergency carbs as you’re building up your mileage. Bonking is a real thing and can leave you stranded if you’re out in the middle of nowhere. 

How do I feel now that I’m home? My stomachs a bit upset and I feel bloated. I will be right back to keto. It’s what makes me feel best when I’m not doing long endurance rides. 

I MAY do TKD (targeted keto diet, not tae kwon do, LOL) on these long rides. During the week when I’m doing shorter rides, I will do them 100% keto. But for the long rides I may experiment with simple carbs before and during the ride. 

Anyway, this is just my experience and not a knock against keto - it’s doing other wonderful things for my health. Just some observations, especially for those who do longer (4+ hour) endurance work. 

TL;DR - Bonked on long bike ride while eating keto, ate a bunch of carbs to make it back. May eat Targeted keto in the future with some carbs around long rides.

pdg0oo,4 Months Progress! 200-&gt;170 Feeling good!,"[Progress pics](https://imgur.com/a/FLkiW8A)

Feeling a lot better about myself these days and wanted to share my progress! 30lbs down! I'd developed a pretty heavy drinking problem during quarantine (liter of vodka a night) and knew I needed a big change. Big shoutout to the folks at r/quitdrinking. 

Disclaimer being obviously this progress isn't just keto, I've been working out fairly heavily the past four months as well and love having the motivation back to do so. I was on keto for a couple years around 5 years ago for my acne which was super bad and keto did an amazing job clearing it up. Eventually I just grew out of it I guess and stopped keto for a while there. My goal is to get down to around 10% body fat and start trying to bulk up more muscle. 

The best thing for me was meal prep, I'd make stir fry of 5lb of chicken, broccoli, and mushrooms and eat that as a big giant meal most nights. I did 16/8 IF and my day only really consisted of a protein shake, a couple snacks of small sausages or cold cuts or whisps, and a big dinner meal. Usually hit around 160g of protein a day and ate at a pretty big deficit, usually around 1200cals. 

May be controversial but every four weeks I'd take a weekend off, eat anything and as much as I wanted. I think that helped me a bit because of the large deficit towards the end of the month I'd be feeling weaker on my lifts and that carb refuel seemed to help. Also would keep me strict knowing that I could hold out from cravings till a cheat weekend. YMMV on this though, I know for some people once you give in it would be harder to get back on it.

pde7we,It's monthly experiment time!,"Thanks to everyone who has been doing monthly experiments with me! What did you learn in August and what's your experiment for September?

Here's mine:

MY AUGUST 2021 EXPERIMENT:
- Macros: 140 protein including collagen daily; carbs under 23 max with most days at 20. 
- Exercise: some type at least 3x per week. Complete half marathon.
- Mood: don't weigh at all during the month. No alcohol.

MY AUGUST RESULTS:
- Hard to hit protein at first, but now hitting/exceeding daily. Learned a lot about protein and the choices I need to make to fit it in.
- finally found my groove with under 20g carbs. Upping protein helped a ton. I finally ""get"" how to stay under 20. It was about swapping. Milk for almond milk. Premiere protein for Isopure. High carb cheeses to goat cheese. All these add up, and I finally figured out how to keep eating lots of Vegetables without going over 20. 
- exercise was amazing!!! Averaged 5x/week. This was the real game changer. I got over my fear and with the protein...dang..had serious gains. I had so much fun trying new things. I did: rollerblading, Barre, tai chi, body pump, water HIIT, running, walking, yoga, TONS of things I'd never tried before. I had serious fun and felt like a kid again! :) Also, multiple times this month I ""discovered"" a new muscle. I was at the dinner table and pointed to something and everyone in the family went ""whoaaaaaa"" all at the same time bc of my new muscles. My body composition is changing a ton, but more importantly, I'm feeling athletic! Something I'd never have considered before. Finished my first half marathon and am super proud of how I'm changing what I think is possible for myself and allowing exercise to be fun! 
- mood and sleep were fantastic! Finally caved and got a Fitbit and am learning a lot about my sleep. No panic attacks for another month in a row! 

MY SEPT 2021 EXPERIMENT:

- track carbs only and stop tracking calories.
- stick with 20g or less carb daily
- stick with no alcohol
- up my workout goal to some kind of exercise 5 days/week
- target 7 hours minimum sleep each night 

Hypothesis 1: I think this will help me start to understand hunger. Bc I'm so calorie focused, I track the night before and think I'm eating when I'm not hungry just to ""stick to the plan"" 

Hypothesis 2: im interested to know if this leads me to IF, which I haven't been ready to try yet. Will it happen naturally? I think it may. Excited to find out. 

Hypothesis 3: I want to learn to have calm around my WOE without needing control it so tightly. I'm curious if I'll be anxious at first with not tracking every single vitamin, macro, calorie, and nutrient. I'm curious if I'll learn to trust myself/my body versus my tracker.

pdci07,Bulletproof Coffee,"I’m fairly new to keto and I read about bulletproof coffee as a good way to head start your day. My question is, would it be recommended to drink it before or after a workout?

What would be the best way to go about it? Thanks in advance.",keto,1
pdb502,How it's going so far.,"Hey I just wanted to tell you alittle about my keto journey so far. I'm a student and really don't have too much money to spend. Before my keto start, I mostly stuck to eating sandwiches. If i find something I like, I pretty much eat that thing until I get tired. So even before the diet I basically ate the same meal everyday. 

My keto diet consists of eating 500 grams ( 5 patties ), of hamburger meat, once a day. These patties have 1.2 grams of carbs each, and about 212 calories. Sometimes I use salt and pepper on top, just to give my tastebuds something new everyother day. And I use a really small amount of sugarfree ketchup. The ketchup has about 6 grams of carbs pr 100 grams. I would say I use about 30 grams each meal. ( Some days, i choose to eat pork chops, beef, or something else low on carbs. And I stay at around 1100-1300 calories each meal).

The first week of keto was really not that bad for me. Since my only meal was at 4:30 PM everyday after school, I started to get hungry at around 1 or 2 PM. I sometimes felt alittle shaky when I was close to the full 24 hours after the meal. 

After the first week, I noticed that I stopped going to the bathroom to poop as often as I usually did before. Before the diet it was about 1-2 times a day. Now its about 3-4 times a week. The color became darker and the smell changed. 

One month had passed, and I went from 116 kg, to 108.5 kg. I was really happy and kept going. The following 30 days I went down from 108.5, to 102 kg. I was getting closer and closer to my first goal of the journey. Reaching 2 digits on the scale. I got compliments from people I knew, that my face had gotten really skinny, and that my belly was much smaller. I had to go out belt shopping to find something that fitted. Another 2-3 weeks followed and i reached 99 kg's! 

It was right around this time that the summer vacation started. I was moving home to my family for 2 months, and started working at my summer job. I started eating normal carby foods again. When I started eating carby foods again, my hunger went through the roof, and I really didn't feel too good. I felt sleepy, cranky and almost alittle sick all through the summer.  I ate until I was full, and obviously it was too much food. I went from 99 kg's, back to 106. I was really angry with myself, and promised that I would lose that weight again, and eventually get down to around 85 kg where I want to be. Personally it's much easier to stick to the diet when I live alone, because I only buy the foods I intend to eat. 

Now, the summer vacation is over, and I moved back to study engineering again. I just finished my first week of keto, and I feel GREAT. When I eventually start eating normally again, I will not make the same mistake as last time. I WILL get a meal plan, and follow it strictly. Because gaining those kg's last time was too painful for me. 

The keto diet is the only diet that I have managed to stick to, and I personally feel that it's the perfect diet for me. My goal of losing weight, is to get better self esteem, and feeling better about myself. Not if, but WHEN, I reach my goal of 85 Kg, I will make another post here to tell you about the rest of the journey. 

Feel free to ask questions, or give me advice, and I will try to answer :)",keto,1
pdaaft,Need ideas and motivation! Please help.,"Hello everyone, I'll try to not be lengthy.  I started Keto back at the end of December because I was tired of hating my image in the mirror.  I did lazy Keto just mainly staying under 20 net carbs and having smaller portions.  I managed to lose 50 pounds within 6 months.

Beginning of June I started going through a divorce... moving back in with my dad, changing my job position, I started slacking.  I have maintained but I'm ready to get back on it as this past month I've gained back 8 pounds and I'm disappointed in myself.

What I'm asking for is ideas for easy snacks and lunches for work.  Something that I can meal prep for the week as I don't have much time in the morning to do much (work 6am-2pm).  I just get tired of cycling through the same couple of things all the time.

pd9gdh,Keto’s magic for me,"I’ve attempted low carb eating multiple times in the past but always fallen off for one reason or another. One thing I struggled with was not eating enough fat and too much protein. Also cramping. This time around I’ve wanted to stick to keto and prioritized fat and have done a better job supplementing with potassium and magnesium and dropped 16lbs in less than three weeks. 

However, what has really changed for me this time around is the lack of cravings thus far but more importantly my lack of desire to overeat. I’ve been having a version of bulletproof coffee in the morning that will carry me to lunch. Today I got hungry three hours after the coffee and made chorizo with 3 eggs and a bell pepper. Normally I’d eat that no problem but today I couldn’t even finish half and felt totally satiated. It feels great to not be ravenously hungry while being in a caloric deficit.",keto,1

pd8j50,"No more super woman, but would settle for having energy woman","I have to write this before I convince myself I'm better off not doing keto. Quick rundown with my story. I started Feb. 1 and lost about 40 pounds. I stalled at one point, but got some great advice on here and was able to take off another 15 pounds. Well, I hit another stall which was fine, but I had a head full of hair and now my hair has thinned considerably. I take Biotin and vitamins, but it doesn't seem to help. Plus, I started a job where I work graveyard and it messed up my sleep patterns. On top of that I now have plantar fascitis which isn't getting better after a month or so. When I was losing weight and having the benefits of the energy you get on keto I decided I could do a job I've been doing for years which is working harvest. It's an Idaho thing (lol) and a bunch of us work and make it fun and make a lot of good money in 2 months. I think I've bitten more off than I can chew or manage. Keto made me feel like super woman, but when the benefits started to wane I felt it would be best if I add some carbs since I'll be working A LOT of hours. I feel lost without keto, but I've lost so much hair and my foot is killing me and I read where osteoporosis can happen. I'm a 54 year old women and had a hysterectomy, so I dealt with the menopause thing 4 years ago and still had my hair. I might add that the hair I do have growing back has turned gray. I don't mind aging, but feel I might not be getting the nutritional benefits I need. I took magnesium at night to keep my electrolytes good too. I'm just hoping I can go back on keto and for it to be safe for someone my age. Plus, I see people who look soo good after the weightloss with a radiance about them, but I'm just starting to look old. Any advice is appreciated.",keto,1

pd6v3g,How low can you go?,"So.. i wrote another post a couple days ago, asking for help to incorporate high calorie low volume foods. 

But i was just curious about somthing. 
How low in calories can you go?

I will give you an example of my struggle..

I wake up at 10 am. Drink 2 cups of black tea with 1/4 cup non-dairy milk. This satisfies me. I do a 2.5 hour workout from 1-3:30pm. This causes my hunger to be severely blunted. So i dont eat. I eat nothing till dinner at 6. I eat about 100-150 grams chicken breast and 1 cup of broccoli for dinner(example dinner). Then i feel full. I then drink 2 more mugs of tea at night and eat 1 fat bomb before bed. 
I go to sleep not hungry. 

Total calories are 245-500 for the day depending (remember this is hypothetical)

So if my total would be that low in spitr of having a high body fat % , would my body think im starving and lower my metabolic rate ? Or would it think im fasting (think fast 5 diet for example)? 

How low in calorie can you go safely of you have a high body fat % with lots to lose? How often can you do that versus whats safe? 

I feel like im confused because some say "" you need a minimum of 1200 calories to prevent lowered metsbolism"" 

Fast 5 Dr says "" you can safely eat 500 calories and your body is ""fast mimicking"" so its safe and can help.",keto,1

pd072a,do anti-inflammatory benefits exist on diets outside of Keto?,"hi all.

i’ve done Keto for a month and a half last year around Feb. the main reasons why i did Keto was for the anti-ADHD benefits. at the time i was trying to see if i could manage my ADHD without meds. as i’m on my meds now, you can probably guess that i’m also not on Keto anymore. meds simply work better for me, however i acknowledge that Keto might work better for others.

two things i was absolutely ecstatic by, however, were:

1. the amount of weight i trimmed around my belly. i have a naturally skinny fat body type, so seeing the fat basically get ripped out of my body was an absolute dream.

2. the quality sleep. WOW. i would wake up consistently, everyday, feeling like i was a phone plugged in overnight to 150%. i woke up feeling ready to jump out of bed and tackle the world. every day. man do i miss that feeling. until this unintended side effect, i never realized how bad my sleep quality was and how much bad sleep could negatively compound my daily life in terms of memory and cognition, naturally positive thought, and naturally occurring motivation. this quality sleep i attribute mostly to the anti-inflammation affects of keto as i was indeed eating healthy and choosing my plate as carefully as possible, and i’ve noticed through qualitative search that not everyone experiences good sleep on keto, for some it’s the opposite.

currently in regards my living situation, i don’t have a settled place i can call home, therefore i don’t have any of my own kitchen supplies, an exercise/gym schedule or routine, or even a normal cooking/eating routine (i usually bulk cook). i may try keto again in the future once i am settled down.

in the mean time i am seeking some of the very beneficial anti-inflammatory properties of keto, without keto. does anyone have experiences with reaching maybe 75% - 90% the anti-inflammatory effects that kept has, but on other diets? namely a diet that promotes the same good quality sleep keto induced for me.",keto,1

pcnt18,"[long post] Depression, Binge Eating and Keto","
Hi friends, I am 22M 5'8, SW 245lb, CW 215, GW 165.
Content warning for mental illnesses. For all of my life I have been overweight in some form. With that, and some other things, I have always had body image and overall self image issues, being diagnosed with depression at about 14-15 years of age. The first, best coping mechanism I really found after the diagnosis was exercise. However, exercise with a bad diet doesn't get me anywhere. Flash forward to starting college, and I was more motivated than ever to finally change something. 

My mother recommended keto to me, and even without trying it felt like, I went from 245 to 200 in a matter of months. Pretty much as soon as I hit that 200, I hit a stall. And this was because I wasn't tracking. Thankfully once I started tracking faithfully, I finally started seeing more gains. A couple summers later of trial and error, I finally got down to 185lbs after waffling for a long time. 

I was able to maintain this for a long time, until covid hit, and August of 2020, I started binging hard. An entire pizza a night, it got so bad my feet were swelling and shoes didn't fit. I finally got  diagnosed with binge eating disorder. And for me, this is a coping mechanism due to my feeling of never being good enough. I would bust my ass dieting, and I wouldn't find the results I would be looking for, or I just wouldn't be validated.

It would take several months for me to go back on keto, and so far it was much harder than it was the first time around. I've only gone down 10 lbs, and it's a constant mental back and forth for me not to binge. Basically I have to be proactive as much as I can to toss out or not have the keto foods I will binge on. Cheese is the main culprit.

I weighed myself today after at least a month and am only down 10lbs from the 225. Keto friends who have successfully got down on the fat and beaten mental barriers, how do I find success? Everyone is a different person with intricacies that cannot be properly articulated, but I need to find some ideas on how to fight this in new ways, and to adapt.",keto,1

My clothes fit better, my back hurts a lot less, my asthma seems to be getting better, and I’m starting to have more energy. This is the longest I’ve stuck with anything in the past 3+ years and I’m so happy with the results. My doctor said he was really impressed and was happy I’m giving keto a try. He said he wants to hold me accountable and wants to see me back in 3 months. I’ve been doing strict keto since July 28th and other than struggling with water and electrolytes, it’s worked out really well for me! I’ve started to stall a little on my progress but I know I just have to keep going and it will keep coming off slowly but surely. 

Thinking about adding the gym in this month now that my energy is coming back. Going to start with some basic weights and maybe a little cardio here and there but I get a fair bit of cardio at work.

I have hit a plateau since, but I altered my regimen. 
I added back diet soda, moderate alcohol, and started exercising (walking &amp; weights). I feel great and am sleeping 100x better than I was before. 
I need to find a ""happy medium"" for keto to be long term sustainable for me. I can live without bread, pasta, and rice, but I am struggling with foods that are what I consider ""on the fringe"".
I understand the concept of net carbs, but still find myself focusing on the top line number. 
I recently started looking at some of the foods that are marketed as keto-friendly and am skeptical of their claims. Do you really count something with 18g carbs and 15g fiber as 3g ""net carbs""?? Is there a limit to the number of carbs fiber can offset???",keto,1

pcd8jx,Idea to include grass fed meat on keto on a budget!,"Its simple. Im always trying to find creative ways to eat high quality foods at an affordable budget. 

My plan is to eat vegan every other day to avoid meat. My meat portions are small anyway. Usually a 2 chicken thighs or small scoop of ground beef, rest is usually eggs, avocados ,vegetables, walnuts, olives. The only difference would be to remove my meat portion for 1 (even 2 days), and add more eggs to fill the macros/calories back in. My meat portion is at $1.50 a day so cheap(but its regular meat). Im considering going the grass fed route. Its at $5-$10 a day depending to go this route on just the meat portion alone. Not to mention the rest of the meal.

My ""life hack"" is to get grass fed through a subscription box company. But only eat meat every other day(or maybe 2 vegan days/1 regular day). This would reduce the monthly price of grass fed beef to 1/2-1/3 its original price. Essentially the same price to eat a regular meat portion daily.

Im mentioning to:

1) get feedback from anyone who has tried Vegan Keto.


2) promote my idea, allowing those on a budget to practice a cleaner keto diet, and have their body's safer by eating organic grass fed meat.

No bloating, no acid reflux, nothing funky going on in my digestive tract once the food was gone from my stomach. Just pure pain beginning 20-30 minutes after ingestion and lasting a few hours. 

I eliminated veggies completely for 10 days and had almost no problems with pain during that time. 

I'm reintroducing veggies this week, small portions (0.5-1 cup) and finding certain veggies are worse than others and are enough to lay me out.

Apparently, because one is fat adapted, being in for example a 1200 calorie schedule would not cause your metabolism to slow down cause its 1200 calories from diet, but the body will pull fat off and your body will not ""starve cause its using its own fat as fuel in addition to the 1200 calories.

Where as a traditional diet if you are 1200cal a day, your body can pull some energy from body fat, but not that much at once, and the metabolism will slow down to balance out. (Basically there is a limit to the rate of fat burn when non keto)

Why am i asking? 

Well because a RCT showed that after a week of keto the subject s got arteriell damage from doing a glucose tolerance test (I AM NOT SAYING KETO CAUSED IT , what i am saying is that the glucose spike caused it because they where not adapted to glucose metabolism) obviously when you transition from a keto diet to a diet with carbs you should slowly introduce them right ?

pbr8f7,Keto face gains: New vs old drivers license photos after 90 lb weight loss,"[https://imgur.com/a/YXoRkYw](https://imgur.com/a/YXoRkYw)

I was blown away when I got my new license yesterday so I thought I'd share here since it was all thanks to low carb living.  These photos were taken 5 years apart but most of the weight loss occurred over a period of about 1.5 years.  I was just going to post the photos, but since I have to get to 200 characters for this post not to be auto rejected, I'll just add a few thoughts that may seem pretty cliche.  First, low carb living is best viewed as a lifestyle, not a diet.  Second, one should strike a balance between self accountability and self forgiveness.  There were certainly days where I wasn't on plan, but as I've gotten older I've gotten better about keeping my eye on the long view.  As long as the arrow is pointed in the right direction over the long run, a few days off plan don't matter.  The key is to not let days turn into weeks or months.  Okay, cliched speech over.",keto,1

It took time to get fat, it takes time to lose it.","When I started back on keto, I was in a pretty bad place. None of my clothes fit, looked like garbage, and felt worse. I was discouraged my first two weeks of keto, because I actually gained weight and had wicked brain fog. The more time I spend on keto, the more I'm able to realize how broken my relationship with food is and how to fix it - not just what I'm eating but how much and when.

&amp;nbsp;

These last few days I'm finally starting to turn a corner. My energy level is improving, my appetite has diminished, my clothes fit better and my face looks thinner. I didn't realize it, but I'm going to hit 15 pounds of loss this week, which will average to about 3 pounds a week. I'm eating as close to 0 carbs as possible (only getting nominal carbs from vegetables and avocados) and have not eaten any foods I have not processed myself (started making my own mayo, pickles, etcetera).

&amp;nbsp;

That said, what works for someone else might not work for you. You might not lose a lot of weight right away. This is a marathon, not a sprint. Don't focus on the loss, focus on the gains - gaining information on living a healthier lifestyle and applying it. If this ape can do it, you can too. 

&amp;nbsp;

My two pieces of advice: get off the dairy as soon as possible. It's almost required in the beginning to manage the change, but the saturated fat will really mess with you. The other thing: invest in all of the different types of Mrs. Dash. Seriously. Up your spice game.

Currently on week #4, of keto.

So.. let me first say that I love food, I am not anorexic and i dont have an eating disorder ( i say this now cause what follows sounds insane to most)

I calculated my macros and I need 1660 calories to lose weight. 

I has VSG weight loss surgery in 2013 but sadly a Dr put me on an sleep medication that is also an appetite stimulant(he didnt tell me they use it for anorexic patients to make them want to eat) Im coming off the medication slowly right now but i have been battling constant weight gain and loss since being on it. Unfortunately the medication was perscribed a month after weight loss which really just negated the effects. 

Basically im hungry all the time and i get shaky if i dont eat after an hour of eating and never feel full no matter what i eat. 

Okay.. so i do keto. Ive been on and off keto over 5 years. My biggest loss was 120 lbs but i gained it all and more cause of my inability to regulate my appetite.

However.. Keto is a miracle because its the only diet in which i dont feel hungry. I added fasting to it. First it was 16:8 and then it turned into 20:4. Also, i added exercise in and that does the opposite of make me hungry. I forget about my true hunger after exercising.

Okay all that said... I know i can not eat ""a lot"" in 1 sitting because im missing 85% of my stomach pouch. So one lettuce wrapped beyond burger or 100 grams of chicken breast and a cup of broccolli or 15 prawns and 1 cup of broccoli or 100 grams of salmon is all i can have in a meal. Its so filling.

Well the combination of fasting which i love, plus exercise taking any hunger away plus my inability to eat lots in one sitting...
My calories are SUPER low. Like 545-860 low.

There was one day last week where i forced myself to eat throughout the whole day. No fasting, no exerise. I just focussed on trying to eat protein and fat and i got my calories up to 1450 but i felt so bloated and ill from constantly feeling like i was eating.
I feel like eating is a chore now.

pb6xf4,Prevent gaining everything back when keto becomes too intense?,"Hey all

I’m having a hard time today with keto and my weight. I had lost 24 pounds down to 191 from 215 in about 2 months while still having one cheat day a week in moderation.

Over the weekend somehow I went back up to 198 and have only been able to go down to 195.

Today i only had 1 meal partially because I got a sore throat/cold and wasn’t in the mood to have eggs and bacon for the 4929848373th time for breakfast, and then because I couldn’t stomach ground beef or chicken for dinner.

It’s now 1:15, I’m starving, but too scared to really eat anything because it’s late and also I just don’t have much I think I can eat that’s keto. It’s so hard to buy all these foods and prepare meals or have keto alternatives to regular food.

I miss cereal, I miss crackers, I miss bread, I miss pasta, but I know I’ll gain all the weight back in like a week once I stop keto as has happened many times before.

My question is, is his bound to happen every time? All the weight just balloons back as soon as you stop? 

I think I’ll just go to sleep now so I won’t feel hungry. I’m just having a rough day. Thanks to whoever reads this and isn’t mean.",keto,1

Hi everyone, I am a student at the University of Washington working with a professor on a research project focused on ketogenic diets and intermittent fasting. 

Your responses to this survey will contribute to our understanding of how following these two diets impact attitudes toward foods and general eating behaviors. 

This survey will take about 10 minutes to complete, and your responses will be anonymous.

It will help us tremendously if you can take the survey. Thank you so much for your time!!

I haven’t been able to have a healthy meal for weeks. Just ramen noodles and fast food. I have no one who will willingly buy me healthy food. I have a lazy mother… she won’t take me to get my permit so I can get my license. Without a license I don’t have a ride to work. I feel like if I had a job I would be able to buy my own food. 

I’ve asked my mom plenty of times to go buy me healthy foods or any food at all. My sister and her boyfriend provide for me now. But who am I to tell them that they have to go to the grocery store and buy me healthy food with there money. They have NO interest in eating healthy either. I feel my body deteriorating. My back hurts everyday, high blood pressure, I have the energy of a 70 year old. I feel like I’m dying at 17 years old. 

Money is an issue in my family but I own two pairs of pants and 4 shirts. What kind of mother doesn’t buy her child clothes? Buy her child food? Ik she can because she keeps buying dumb things off Amazon like a brand new mini fridge for her room. She also eats fast food when she goes to work so she doesn’t bother putting good food in the house. I’m going to turn to an unhealthy way of loosing weight. If I have to eat fast food every day then I won’t eat at all. I can either die from obesity or heart failure or die trying to save myself.",keto,1

pb29ug,"One month on keto, no longer tired after exercise?","I (M/30/6'4"", starting weight 265 current weight 225)started my weight loss in april of 2021, dropped 27 pounds from April to July with CICO and IF. On July 25th, i decided to incorporate the ketogenic diet as a way to mobilize body fat (and be generally healthier overall) and dropped down an additional 16 lbs as of today. I have noticed that i no longer feel post exercise fatigue anymore. I can go to the gym, even in a fasted state, and work out for two hours straight (after 5 years of inactivity) and still be able to go through my day with energy to spare. 

When i first started losing weight and would go for walks around my neighborhood or on a treadmill, i would do 2 miles a day and be exhausted. Even when I was in good shape before my accident, but still a sugar burner, i would have a major energy crash after a heavy gym day.

pazznz,Best Keto routine for sleep?,"Hello there,

Every once in a while I see myself trying to improve my sleep when it's not great and review things I do. Today is the day I guess.

I was wondering if you guys split your macros/nutrients during the day so that at night you will get better sleep. Or if there are things that work for you? Can you share some experience?

I've been experimenting with:

* B3 Niacin (aka pork sausage)
* Magnesium (aka almonds)
* Tryptophan (aka pork sausage again)
* Moving 2/3 of my daily carbs to dinner
* Cacao

I guess what's been working for me is indeed magnesium. Even if it's 10g of cacao with some caffeine it can also put me to sleep sometimes. I also realised today that most of B3 / Tryptophan comes from a pork sausage which I've been eating for my 1st meal at noon. I'll move it to dinner and see what happens. 

This is not a Keto tip, but morning sun exposure does seem to have helped as well after waking up when I have some tea on balcony in the morning.

I'm happy to hear your experiences. I tried researching things online but sadly I don't feel much of it is reliable and 1st person experiences are the best I believe",keto,1

It seems like I'm at higher risk for Heart Disease? The results are puzzling to me. Based on my Homocysteine which tests for Coronary Risk, my risk is low as the ideal is below 8. Even my A1C is low. Based on my cholesterol, I'm high risk. I had a Cardio IQ Lipoprotein FRA performed which should tell me the condition of my LDL whether its Large and Fluffy or small and dense.

Basically my dad, in his late 60s has recently gotten some ""concerning"" lipid results from a cardiologist.  He's not doing keto but he did Atkins in the very distant past to drop an extra 10 or so pounds and I think maybe I could steer him towards keto with the right info.  However, he's easy to put off, so I'm looking for an article or video that anyone might recommend that clearly explains why high LDL in the absence of other red flags is cause to go on statins.   I've been following the low carb community for years and so I'm going to be digging around myself but just thought I'd ask in case anyone has a ""go to"" source so to speak when trying to help family members or friends who are having issues but are skeptical of keto.   Just because he did Atkins years ago doesn't mean he's actually interested in doing keto... It's complicated :)

His numbers don't actually look bad to me.  The two ratios of total/HDL and trig/HDL are ok.  3.6/1 and 1.60/1 respectively.  The LDL is flagged high at 130 and then breaks down the numbers of each size but the main type is type A which I understand to be the ideal large fluffy LDL.  HD CRP is 2.4 which is flagged moderate and his coronary calcium score was I think 60 something.  I'm no doctor but I think this all looks pretty good considering he's late 60s and isn't that fastidious with his diet.  He doesn't eat SAD but hes no stranger to ice cream and other junk foods.

The cardiologist apparently thinks he currently ""has heart disease"" from these readings and once he heard my grandfather had high LDL as well and needed a stint and eventually developed altzheimers and dementia, declared that this is a genetic issue and there's nothing that can be done except to go on a statin to try to prevent a similar outcome for my dad.  The Dr actually said something like ""a change in diet wouldn't accomplish anything because this is genetic"".
My mind is blown.  I know that there's a ton of drs like this but man..  to tell a patient who has MODERATE indicators of a heart problem that there's no point in actually trying to address the problem with food and instead here's this statin..  is just so bonkers IMO.
I shared my thoughts and feelings without judgment because at the end of the day he's an adult and I'm not here to act like some expert who knows the right thing to do for medical conditions.  But jeesh...  I hope he considers my suggestion to lay off the Ben and Jerry's and Hungry Man dinners for a bit and see if that's doesn't adjust the numbers for the better.",keto,1

pahmsi,Keto can change your life,"I began my keto journey mid March. I have Crohn's, as well as other auto-immune disorders, so inflammation is my sworn enemy. With my health slowly spiralling, my weight really got out of control, especially during the covid lockdowns and I finally woke up and realized I needed to make drastic changes or I wasn't going to be around to see my kids grow up.
So, after much research and planning, I started keto. Continuing to research, I learned the added benefits of clean keto and the use of anti-inflammatory ingredients.
More tinkering brought me to intermittent fasting, initially doing 16/8, then adding 24 and 48 hour fasts, and then OMAD. Now, I alternate weekly between 16/8 and OMAD, and include aan extended fast.  
When results began to take hold, I began walking after each meal, and soon I was doing resistance training at home. Now my routine includes a trip to the gym 4-5 days a week.
I'm thrilled to report that since my March 12 start date, ice lost 76 pounds, and I feel great. 
I've recently started adding a very limited carb day each week(very limited, maybe 100 gr), which really seems to help my recovery. 
10 importantLessons learned, in no particular order:
1. Resist the urge to ride the scale.
2. Avoid the slippery slope that exists with the ""keto cheats and sweets""
3. If you're doing it for weight loss, there's no real need to add loads of fat. (You have enough already).
4. Choose lean, organic meat. This let's you control the type of days you consume.
5 Processed=poison
6. Read those labels religiously
7 don't get too bogged down worrying about macros. Reasonable portion of protien, load up on the non starchy veg, and ruthlessly eliminate sugars and you'll be fine.
8 Water, tea, or black coffee. In that order.
9 Watch the Omegas. Eat plenty of oily fish.  Not all nuts are your friend. 
10. Have fun with it. It's really not restricting. It's an opportunity to play with herbs and spices in a way that not only are delicious, but have medicinal properties. 

The keto lifestyle isn't complicated, and it's not difficult, but it does require discipline and some patience. If you're serious about getting healthy, it can change your life for the better.

I've been exerting myself beyond measure, and I am still extremely self conscious about how I look in terms of loose skin/stretch marks. It's so frustrating because I can feel how strong my core is, but no abs showing yet :(

I've been on keto from the get-go; lurking on this sub &amp; the intermittent fasting sub and absorbing all the knowledge I could off of you fantastic beings. 

20g carbs total per day, I eat fatty meats/salads/raw nuts &amp; drink around 3L of water everyday. 

I've been fasting everyday, eating one meal a day with a 1 hour eating window &amp; water fasting for the remainder. I initially started off with 72 hour water fasts, which was very intense.",keto,1

I always played sitting down because it was ""comfortable"" and when I started practicing standing up, my belly was IN THE WAY - the guitar was literally out in front me by what felt like half a mile OR would have to sit way high up on top of the belly. Sitting down to play won't fly for me at the open mic (and I didn't want to be the new fat dude sitting down to play). 

I've finally reached the point where I can strap on a guitar and play standing up and *not* feel 100% awkward (only 15% awkward because I'm honestly not very good - but I love it anyway). It's actually perfectly comfortable and makes a lot more sense now, and is ""down"" and close to me, instead of ""out"" and trying to run away.

I am a pretty regular exerciser. 

I know r/ketorecipes is a good resource - what I guess I’m missing is motivation or some subtle recommendations (especially snacks). The routine of almonds, broccoli, cheese, eggs, is just stale to me very quickly now.

1 cup almond flour
2 tbsp psillium husk powder
2 eggs
2 tbsp hot water
2 tbsp butter (or other oil/fat)
1 tsp baking powder

Before you add the wet ingredients you can add other dry ingredients if you like. I like pumpkin, sesame, poppy and sunflower. Plus salt and pepper.
Try adding garlic, a few berries, nuts or cheese to the base recipe and it still works.


Mix together dry ingredients and then add all the wet ingredients. Mix together with a spoon.

Leave for a few minutes and stir again and it will be a thick mixture.

pa5qq1,45 pounds down today! 🎉,"I joined Reddit years ago for my first round of keto and had great success. Like most of these stories go, I got side-tracked and gained it all back and then some over the years. 

In February of this year, I was looking at photos of myself and decided that enough was enough. The world had be closed for a while and a lot of my friends hadn’t seen me in person for a while. I wanted to make some changes and being stuck at home was a great opportunity to turn things 
around. 

So, I started on February 12, just two days before Valentine’s Day, where I could have indulged in all the chocolate things, and stayed strong. I’ve had a few off days along the way but jumped right back on the wagon. My mom is Korean so when she came to visit I couldn’t not eat my mom’s cooking, haha. I’m planning for the long-term so these days didn’t bring me down as much as they may have in the past. 

I started both keto and IF, starting with 16:8 and naturally worked up to 20:4. It’s been amazing! I don’t worry about food, my cravings are gone, and I feel more even and stable. I always forget how good I feel on keto until I’m back on it. 

I also started using Fitbod and roller skating during the pandemic. I haven’t been as consistent with it lately but was so surprised at how much I enjoyed being active. It’s not as bad when you’re not toting around all that extra weight!

p9wc44,"How do you deal with people who want to lose weight, but don't want to do the work?","I have a friend who messaged me today saying he ""needs to lose 5kg"" and wanted to know if he should do keto or reduced calories. I explained that in order to lose weight, he must reduce calories and keto makes it easier to do that by controlling his hormones.

I told him that the fastest way to lose weight is to fast. He said he could not because he doesn't like feeling hungry. So I explained to him that once he is fat adapted fasting becomes easy since his body can easily satisfy its energy requirements from his own body fat. I then went on to tell him that I don't eat after 4pm and again he said he would be hungry.

So I sent him to the keto calculator and told him how to use it and informed him that if he stuck to those macros, his body will go into ketosis and then become fat adapted and eating at a caloric deficit will become easy.

At that point he said something like, ""I'm not scientific like you"" then went on to say he will just reduce his calories and avoid major carbohydrates. I guess actually calculating your macros and keeping track of what you eat is ""scientific"".

I really think he wanted me to be his keto coach and do the work for him. Calculate his macros and give him some recipes. It certainly is not something I would want to do, so I wished him luck.",keto,1

I'm following my macro's strictly, 140g protein, \~100g fat, usually never make it over 75 and rarely over 50, and 25g net carb. 

After I eat I feel bloated and very full like a puffer fish and It's really hard to make it through the meal. I check my macro tracker and I'm only at 900-1100 calories depending on if I added peanut butter to my shakes or how much protein I  had that day, hitting most of my macros already. Is this problematic that im averaging around 1100 calories a day?

I changed up my macro's recently approximately 5-6 days ago

IF i eat at 12 noon, I don't feel hungry in the slightest even into 6pm the next day. 

I take an electrolyte supplement after my workout to cover my nutrients and every 3rd day I take a complete multivitamin. 

My daily meal is this: 

Morning shake is kale, spinach, protein powder, peanut butter, and coconut flakes - every day.

2 hours later after the shake is is 1-3 pieces of salmon/chicken/turkey/sausage, cauliflower rice, and asparagus cooked with avocado oil-- I am somebody who doesn't have issue with eating the same exact thing every day and I find it much easier to manage and to me it's preferred.

1 scoop of preworkout before my workouts , moderate to high intensity training then a scoop of protein after I'm done. 

I don't feel hungry or tired but I am really concerned that I am doing harm to my body. 

Does anyone have any idea?

Hello! This is my 3rd time trying Keto again. First time I tried it was 2 years ago when a classmate brought up the diet. I attempted it and lost around 15 pounds in a month. I was impressed, but I was overwhelmed with too many new things to keep track (including school) so I fell off the wagon. My weight had its up and downs since then. Unsure if it was safe to lose weight so quickly too.

I decided to try again since the covid situation made me gain weight really easily. I work physically so I take that as part of my daily exercise. I'm using carb manager to track around 15-20 net carb everyday. I started near the beginning of this month and lost a total of 10 pounds so far!

I hope I can keep this up. I got a routine going, but I struggle trying to make creative food to eat, since food is expensive here in Canada and I hate spending more than 15 bucks on each meat, but that's just me being sore about it haha. I'm also have a huge sweet tooth so that's really difficult at times too. 

I really want to try and hit below 175 pounds for the first time in 10 years. Then go even lower to the point that I can just smack my will-be-less round stomach and be ecstatic about it. Will do my best, wish me luck! 

Let me know if there's any concerns you want to share since I'm still learning about this diet, or suggestions for easy quick recipes! I'm down for those.

If there is one thing that contributed to my long term success with Keto, it's the decision to create a Staple Food. A Food that you can create in massive quantities and store servings of for later use, whenever you don't feel like cooking (and on keto, there is *a lot* of cooking). 

Feel free to post your own staples. 

For myself, my simple concoction is Broccoli + Salted Butter + Meat (Usually Chicken Breast or Ground Beef). I likely don't have to tell you how to cook up something so simple, but just in case:

Take several bags of Frozen Broccoli and dump them in a gigantic frying pan. Add in liquid butter (1Cup to 1KG of Broccoli works well) and fry while covered until tender. Cook the meat separately, then stir in after veggies are cooked. Stir up until the consistency of casserole, add salt to taste, and store portions frozen. Alternatively, add Soy Sauce to taste when using Pork or Chicken for a zesty alternative.",keto,1

I’ve been doing Keto for 3 weeks now and I have been loving it. I find it relatively easy to plan meals and stay below my carb max. 

Here is where I am getting confused: when I started keto I was barely hitting 50g carbs per day but I dropped 15 pounds in 2.5 weeks. Now I am routinely getting closer to 30g carbs without trying and I haven’t lost a pound. Is this normal? Should I try and eat more carbs and slowly lower myself from 50 to 40 to 30? Maybe the “shock” of dropping to 30 has caused my body to hold on to “everything”? 

Lastly, my wife recently started keto and she also loves it. But she is going about the carb limit slightly differently. I will spread my carbs out throughout the day and she will be without carbs or below 10g carbs the whole day and then have an ice cream bar with 23g carbs (sugar) after dinner.

I started at 125-130 and went down to about 115 (sounds low but i’m pretty petite so it was a healthy weight for my size) and then it plateaued around there. it did wonders for my skin too, went from bad acne to basically clear. recently, i’ve been eating a lot less though. unintentionally- i’ve just been waking up kinda late and then only eating a small snack in the morning and then dinner later. i’m also on a medication (for mental health reasons) that cuts my appetite too so even if I should feel hungry, I don’t, so I haven’t realized it. i’ve learned from my mom who’s been looking lots into keto that you don’t have to eat 3 meals a day anyway, so I thought it was ok, but i’m only now starting to realize that this might be kind of unhealthy for me. I’ve started to lose weight again, I think I’m at around 107 now, and if I lose any more i’m worried the doctors will take me off the medication to limit ED risk. i’ve also felt like I have less energy, plus I developed a keto rash across my back (which has happened to me once before from eating too little.) but I don’t know how to gain the weight back in a healthy way or without gaining too much. I can’t really eat 3 meals a day because of the medication anyway, I just eat before I take it and then after it wears off. and I don’t want to go off keto and gain a bunch of water weight again and be all bloated and ruin my skin after months of commitment to this diet so I could finally feel confident with how I look.

Has anyone successfully transitioned from being on a Keto diet for weight loss back to a more balanced diet and been able to maintain their goal weight? 

Keto is impressive in how fast you’re able to drop the pounds, but I’m wondering if, once you start to consume more carbs again, you automatically gain back that water weight immediately and if there are any other scientific drawbacks to this approach.

p9ermo,About the ongoing autobot scolding of people who describe their dietary plans using protein-carbs-fat percentages or ratios,"The AutoModerator Bot on here is often auto-triggered to comment:

""Welcome to r/keto! It sounds like you’re a little confused about how to measure your macros.  Percentages and macronutrient ratios are only relevant if you are doing Keto to manage an epileptic disorder.  Otherwise we strongly encourage you to measure your macros in grams.""

Every time this pops up, I wince, because it's needlessly militant, patronizing, scolding, and wrong.

This auto-text is what happens when ketoers new to the channel innocently try to express their dietary goals in terms of macronutrient percentages (of total daily calories, as budgeted for their particular age, sex, activity level, their current weight, their desired weight, and how quickly they want to get where they're going).

To me, it's a quick, shorthand way of their trying to give the audience here the flavor of their dietary plan, particularly for expressing how strict they're wanting to be on the carbs, or actually the net carbs.  Net carbs throttled back to be as low as 5 percent of an overall daily caloric limit translates to pretty hard-ass keto, for instance, whereas 10 percent net carbs is more of a softer, low-carb approach.  Using these numbers to describe a diet is not wrong; in fact, it's perfectly legitimate.

By contrast, this subreddit has developed an ideology which clings to a flat statement that 20 grams of net carbs should be the daily goal for everybody wishing to lose weight, no matter how overweight you are at the moment.  That may be in the ballpark for strict keto, and for many people, but it's not strictly correct for all people all the time.  The percentages, on the other hand, correctly and inherently accommodate to everybody's individual situation.  

There are many, many published resources which, in fact, prescribe a keto or low carb diet by percentages or ratios.  People quickly learn to derive their macro grams by simple math, applying their goal percentages to their total caloric budget, and then doing some division, 4 grams per kcal for carbs and protein, 9 grams per kcal for fats, and so on.  It may be confusing to some, but it's not wrong.

Claiming that the percentages or the ratios are \*only\* relevant in the historic realm of treating epilepsy is, at best, an over-simplification, and, at worst, a flat-out lie.

Protein-Carbs-Fat ratios in the neighborhood of 25%-5%-70% or 20%-5%-75%, in fact, lurk inside the formulas for every keto macro calculator out there, including the one that's linked on the front-page sidebar of this group.

I originally turned to Keto because I gained weight due to my PCOS and a severe pulmonary embolism I had a couple years ago. Mixing that with a cervical cancer diagnosis this year, and a major surgery coming up. I felt it would be a good idea to lose a few pounds. Shortly before receiving my cancer diagnosis, I  drove out to a nature sanctuary to kill myself, but almost hitting a deer, and wiping out stopped that. 

Since my intro post, however, I actually did manage to lose a bit of weight and broke below 190 which I haven't been for a few years now.

Then a few weeks ago I had a very close death in my family and ate myself a silly, destroying all the progress I had made.

Overall 2021 has not been a good year for me. However, I'd say it's going a lot better than folks in other parts of the world. I am not trying to diminish my problems either, but I definitely do try to see the light, I really do. I think because I suffer from bipolar depression, I really can't not do it. I think sometimes when all you get to eat are shit sandwiches, you just have to sprinkle on some salt, pretend it's peanut butter, and be glad there aren't more bodily fluids in it.

Anyways I digress. Even after all this BS, I told myself one thing. Meal prep keto meals for when you are done your surgery, and just start again. One foot in front of the other.

Now that I've had a few days to recover and gain my wits, I am ready to go again.

I made:
•Raspberry cheesecake fat bombs
•Keto cinnamon muffins
•Keto brownies 
•Italian sausage and veggies bake
•Porkrind Buttermilk chicken and cauliflower mac and cheese
•Chicken Alfredo with zoodles
•Ground pork and parmesan skillet

p9br3f,Beginners Must Read This,"The concept of the ketogenic diet was first used by Russell Wilder in 1921. The ketogenic diet was designed to be effective in the treatment of epilepsy at that time. However, today this diet; It is applied by many people for purposes such as losing weight, eating healthy, and successful results are obtained with diet. 

Ketogenic diet; It is a low-carb and high-fat diet. The ketogenic diet is effective in weight loss as well as having a positive effect on health. The ketogenic diet, which is based on a high fat and low carbohydrate intake; It is similar to Atkins and the low-carb diet. In the keto diet, the person's daily carbohydrate intake is severely limited and it is ensured that they take fat instead of carbohydrates. A significant reduction in carbohydrate intake causes the body to enter a metabolic state called ketosis. When this happens, the body starts to burn fat as an energy source. In the liver, fats are converted into ketones and energy is produced for the brain to use.
If you are wondering how to start a ketogenic diet, you can see a lot of resources on the Internet. You can see a lot of books on the Internet. Unfortunately, most of these resources are inconclusive about the ketogenic diet. 

People who start a ketogenic diet may experience different health problems  after a few weeks. But if you find a solid source and design a diet for yourself based on it. You can easily lose weight without any health problems.",keto,1

I used to fast in the morning but now I must eat first thing in the AM to take my meds. 

Due to medication side effects, my stomach pretty much constantly hurts with gas pain or like the acidic churning feeling you get when you drink too much coffee (no heartburn/burping though). I vary between going to the bathroom normally or not being able to go. If I add a bunch of veggies, my stomach hates them even though I love them. 

As terrible as it sounds/feels, this med combo actually has the least terrible side effects and it’s working well for me otherwise and I am hopeful they won’t be permanent. My primary care doctor basically shrugged and suggested pepto. 

Wondering if I need to give up previously okay alternative sweeteners, dairy, etc. Protein shakes hate me now, too. 

Any thoughts on foods/recipes/practices that might help me get my keto back on track without killing my tummy? Things that would feel appealing when I hate eating (which is pretty much daily right now with the constant tummy ache)

YES I tested that I am in ketosis, test 10 times in 3 weeks and levels were between 1.0 - 2.0
YES I count calories and I have a decent deficit.

The scale that I have also shows body fat percentage (not sure how accurate ) which started at 30.1 and now is 28.2 and this has almost consistently gone down.

I've been only been on this diet for a week so I sincerely doubt collagen deficiency has already manifested itself, but it's worth mentioning I also snack on pork rinds a lot(they have a lot of collagen, or so I'm told). 

This sort of thing is posted ad-nauseam, I'm sure the mods are getting a little sick of it. But the posts I've rifled through all list the 3 things above as the cause. Stands to reason, I'm genetically predisposed to hair loss so maybe this was bound to happen to me on this diet. 

My depression has completely gone away over night and the persistent brain fog I was experiencing has been cut in half, so if it's between keeping my hair or keeping my mind, I choose the latter. But I'd like some thoughts. Thanks a lot.",keto,1

p83ijj,"Trying to lose weight; new to Keto; also trying to incorporate OMAD as well. Just trying to understand what my diet is supposed to be, among other questions.","Using the keto macro calculator, I've been given these numbers:

&gt; Generated by calculo.io/keto-calculator
&gt; ***
&gt; Gender: Male | Age: 30 | Weight: 140 kg | Height: 193 cm
&gt; 
&gt; Calorie Goal: 40% Deficit 
&gt; 
&gt; Protein: 158g  
&gt; Carbs: 20g  
&gt; Fat: 101g  
&gt; 
&gt; Target: 1624 kcal

First of all, before anyone points out, yeah, that's a 40% deficit. I understand that the FAQ on the subreddit recommends a 15-20% deficit for weight loss, but this is just me trying to prove a point to my family as fast as possible, because they are firmly in the 'Eat less, move more' camp of weight loss procedure. Haven't been successful in trying to explain how keto nor fasting work, because they aren't great at English, so throwing medical concepts at them in English was a bad idea. If anyone wants to throw me some resources in Korean, that would be awesome.

So my questions of keto are:

1. If I intend on committing to an OMAD schedule, then using those macros as a guideline, am I to be eating all 158 grams of protein in that one meal?
2. If my assumption from Q1 is correct, then..... what exactly are my food options without getting too expensive? I currently live in a more rural area of Korea, and I expect myself to still be here for a while. The cheapest protein that's also easy to prepare is going to be eggs, but I don't really see myself eating more than 2 dozen eggs in one sitting. Fish is also easy to get a hold of, but I don't typically see fish available in the form of filets that are easy to portion and calculate the macros of like I've seen in the US. I don't consider red meat an option, it's a lot more expensive here than in the states. Same with chicken and pork.

Honestly, just thinking about how I'm going to portion things has stressed me out greatly. I'm just planning this stuff out and it's stressing me out this much. Any additional guidance would be appreciated.",keto,1

I was off work for 2 weeks and kinda came off keto the first week (no bread or sweets but some battered fish, couple of onion rings, couple pints of beer) and put a few pounds on. The second week I came properly off the diet. ate bread twice, ate 4 doughnuts, some ice cream, some cheesecake, a small pizza, drank about 14 beers. 

I weighed myself last Saturday morning (14th) and i had gone from 186 to 200 in just two weeks. I was straight back on the diet and this is the best bit. I had zero cravings for any of the bad stuff. I am back on keto with no problems at all, the mental fear has been broken!

When I left the office, I weighed about 315 pounds. For the last 6 months I've been sitting around 165 pounds (took me 1 year to lose the weight). We're not fully back in the office yet, but I've stopped in here and there and still find myself surprised at other people's surprise, even though rationally I get it.

p7f0jk,Does MCT oil slow down the body learning to break down stored fat?,"Hi everyone - I've just started keto about a week ago.  It was going very well but then I started feeling quite nauseous about 3 days in and had a splitting headache.  I'm certain I'm getting enough salt because I'm using it in water during my 18:6 fasts.  I did some research and decided to try MCT oil and my headache went away almost instantly.  I feel fantastic using MCT oil now - it's like a miracle cure.

However, my understanding is that the reason I was feeling ill was because my body wasn't quite fat-adapted yet so it was still learning to break down stored fat into ketos at a high enough rate.  By supplementing MCT I am providing my body with fats that are easier to break down into ketones and for my brain to use?

So my question is - if I continue to use MCT oil during the adaptation period, am I stopping my body adapting to breaking down more complex molecules into ketones by providing it with easy to break down ones?",keto,1

Many keto followers complain about side effects like cramps or brain fog when cutting curbs that usually go away after getting electrolytes. However, please bear in mind that carbs on its own can deplete certain minerals like magnesium (Mg).

You are likely to arrive to your first week of keto pretty depleted of magnesium (Mg), losing potassium and sodium after day 1, better said your kidneys not holding on them for a while, while wondering what’s wrong with you.

Magnesium is pretty much the foundation and completely necessary to potassium buildup. Without correcting Mg is virtually impossible to fix that @#$&amp;* potassium deficiency is messing with you at many different levels.

So, I have tried keto before and hated drinking bullet proof coffee. It makes me gag and there's no other way about it. 

Today I broke down and made some at home, just because I wanted to use the new tumbler my mom got me. I put my usual creamer in it and it just tasted...ugh. It was super bitter and all those carbs (60) made me sick at work.

I felt sluggish, weighed down, and could barely keep my eyes open. I had to go sick in a dark room because of the pounding headache I had and the need to vomit was almost too much. Thankfully I didn't go home from work.

It also created havoc with my blood sugar. Injected too much insulin and caused myself to crash which led to the further consumption of carbs and another bout of nausea. 

And so, I am saying so long to coffee for good. I don't need it. I don't rely on it to kick start my ""mornings"" and honestly, I didn't miss it when I wasn't consuming it.

M 5'9'' 240 Lbs, I am considered obese, and I started Keto 11 days ago. I've taken in 25g of carbs every day since the day I started. I am wondering, since I don't have anybody to ask, if I am eating too many calories to lose weight. I go to the gym 7 days a week and don't leave till I hit 400 calories on the treadmill but that's beside the point.

I haven't lost any weight outside of 3 pounds which everybody is saying is water weight. I drink approximately 120oz of water a day and in my head writing this I'm thinking -- it's only been 11 days stop whining. but seeing the posts here have motivated me and some people have miraculous weight loss. I take MCT oil in the morning with a protein shake and peanut butter.

My meals are measured so that I have the nutrients I need and hit the target macros. I have attached my macros that I've been religiously tracking on this app I use if that helps. If anybody has any suggestions, I would appreciate them and I thank you in advance.

I probably sound like such a keto noob right now lol but I'm committed! Lately I've been slacking on the fats as I have a job interview coming up I have to study for so I havent had time to go to Trader Joes.

p77060,A girl says she couldn't lose weight on 50 calories a day until she tried keto.,"This is a bit lengthy so bear with me. Note: this post is not meant to diagnose, treat or to give medical advice to any individual.

There is a case of a girl that struggles with an eating disorder (bouts of anorexia followed by bulimia/binge eating for a long time). She alleges that she was unable to lose weight on only 50 calories a day for an extended period. To be fair, she seems to be struggling from severe complications due to a chronic hormone imbalance that caused her symptoms such as fatigue, depression, anxiety, suicidal and violent homicidal thoughts. In the video, she describes frightening details like the lack of coordination between her hand and her brain- completely unable to recall simple things or struggling to write information she knew because her hand could not move. Apparently autoimmune conditions and infections at a youthful age affect your metabolism and make it slow! Not to mention that the thermogenesis (fat burning) pace tends to slow down and adapt to low calorie intakes.

Honestly, this video blows my mind in so many ways because fans of ‘calories in, calories out’ tend to ignore the hormonal and physical component to weight loss. A calorie is NOT a calorie. You cannot compare a piece of fruit to a chocolate bar, and you cannot compare steak to an egg, even if they have the same calories. The affect on insulin, leptin and ghrelin must not be ignored. This is not to say that a ‘pure or healthy’ keto diet is healthy in all cases, because that was not the case for me. A ketogenic diet caused me to lose weight very rapidly and the ketones were literally eating up my liver, which prompted my body to redistribute the fat to shield the liver from damage.

I really think that ketogenic diets can be helpful in some cases. Some doctors claim that they help epileptic kids, but the truth that it can only used as a replacement for a specific type of medications. I think that decreasing your carb intake can help you feel more satiated, but some people can function on chocolate, sweets and fries all day and are doing extremely well in their restriction. Doctors even go far along to say that a carnivore diet will completely eliminate mood swings, nightmares and depression.

p721nv,Meal Prep option for OMAD/KETO my way.,"TLDR My style of meal prepping is to prep 5 portions of a meal every night for 6 nights to then have a month supply of pre-calculated meals that are MICRO and MACRO calculated for OMAD/KETO.

It occurred to me that my way of meal prepping might help someone who's new or maybe a bit bored. This is a comment I just posted and thought someone might benefit from it for motivation or something. I love all you guys and want to pass on my 2 years of yoyo keto experience. I always came back within 2 weeks of trying to go back to ""normal"" and I think after 2 months back on stricter keto I'm set to stay since I hate being any other eating style.

 Are you tracking with something like [cronometer.com](https://cronometer.com/)?

I was a bit concerned when I first started so I used this app to track my micronutrients and make sure overall I'm getting everything I need. What I found is that over a week long period I filled every aspect of my micros if I was very varied in my keto diet. But I would typically make the same meal for 3-4 days and just eat like that. In my mind it was a lot of work for me every day just cooking a single portion of something and I couldnt do it so I needed to adjust my cooking habits. Cue Meal Prepping.

I figure out my meals for a week in advance to hit maximum micros and fit my Keto Macros all in OMAD. I make a different meal each night for a week but now I make 5 portions of each. I freeze 4 of them and eat 1 portion. At the end of 6 days I now have a months worth of meals all calculated and frozen ready to reheat. I 36-40hr fast over Mondays so I dont meal prep that day. I can eat which ever of the 6 meals I want in any order and know I'm all set with my calculations/nutrition. The next month I get new meals x 6, so it keeps the variety for me.

I still leave 20% of all my macros so I can choose desserts or snacks when I want to not be stale and feel trapped by the diet. I also feel zero guilt if I go out with friends and have a keto friendly meal that isnt trackable, because again its not a prison lunch system.

p6yi2n,"alcohol, sugar-alcohols, splenda? [physiology and psychology]","I started keto just a week ago.  
It's popular, so inevitably I've heard about it over the last oh, 8 years, from various friends or coworkers who tried it, one who was truly diligent.    


Had some surprises, like I knew cream was keto-friendly, so I assumed milk was, too-- it's just watery cream right? haha.  oops, oh well.  my keto diet started 2 days later than intended due to that :)  


Well the other surprise was while I'm not much of a drinker myself, it's a common warning to avoid beer+alcohol, so imagine my shock to learn that alcohol itself is... nothing?  not any of the macros: I thought EVERYTHING fit into fat/carb/protein.  


Sure, alcohols &lt;15% have latent sugars the yeast haven't finished with!  so beer still has maltose and barley, wine still has whatever grapes are highest in, but once you get into liquors and distilled alcohols if sugar wasn't added back in, then they're 0g/carb.  I truly had no idea.  


  
There's a lot of popular-nutrition clickbaity ad type articles that really don't explain at all, but what I could find without picking up a cellular biology textbook just yet, is alcohol is sortof in between.    


Like after being broken down part of the way, alcohol drives on to the metabolic beltway at a later onramp than the other macros, part of it sharing the pathway that normal carbs take, most of it sharing the pathway that normal fats take.  
\[until I learn more exact science\] would that analogy suffice?  


  
So.... what does that mean for ketosis specifically?

if alcohol joins the citric acid cycle mid-way through, does it punt you out of a ketogenic state or not?

Put it another way: would a seriously far-gone alcoholic who does nothing but drink and sleep, inevitably be in ketosis?

&amp;#x200B;

umm, liquor isn't my thing.  milkshakes + frappuccinos are my thing.  so giving up alcohol is nothing, the REAL reason that \*I\* am asking is as this pertains to sugar-alcohols like sorbitol and xylitol?  are they genuinely keto-friendly?    


second question.  I'm definitely a sugar-addict, so keto is working for me (no cravings).  
if I look into sugar substitutes, either the sugar-alcohols or splenda, are there any psychosomatic effects to watch out for?  Like, the body thinks it's getting sugar, so it will trigger sugar cravings again?  anything like that?  or the body thinks it's getting sugar, so you get booted out of ketosis...?  just want to be sure.

2months ago...

I hit the lowest point in my life and got really depressed. I basically just threw everything down and stopped feeling sorry for myself. I quit vaping, started keto and intermittent fasting, and light to moderate exercise to improve myself. I can say even though I'm only halfway where I physically want to see myself, I couldn't be any happier with the progress I've made so far. I can personally attest to the fact that mental and physical health are linked together. I don't have a doubt in my mind that this is the case!

Been doing fairly strict keto (sub 50 g of carb most days. Maybe a bit more slip in on other days but otherwise no slips in diet) for 7 weeks. I started at 194 lbs and am now sub-180lbs. I have gotten this far without really counting calories or working out much. 

I am noticing lethargy is and lack of energy hitting me harder than before. I have done  ""refeed"" days after 7-9 days of fairly strict eating and I do feel better for a day or two after and then I am back to feeling meh. 

Any tips for this? Should I start to up my cardio to rev up my metabolism a bit? I wanna keep my progress going but low energy sucks. I did not really have this the first half of the 7 weeks.

I wondered if it might have to do with that instead maybe. There is no research on it though.
Maybe through a deficit or whatsoever. I don't think it is magnesium with me because I supplement it regularily (I know the recommendation in the FAQ).

Now when  I did stop I didnt go crazy ( originally) but as with all addicts the carbs and sweets started coming back in. More and more with each passing month and some of the weight came back too. However the worst thing was the joint pain. My back, shoulders, knees even my hips were hurting. I'd walk up and down the stairs like an old man. Now I've been back on keto for a week now and while not that long I have already noticed my joints dont hurt nearly as much with some not hurting at all.

I hope that you're doing well.

  
I'm a person who's probably on the edge of being pre-diabetic or even surpassed that. I'm somewhat overweight, have been experiencing things like inflammation in the feet and ankles after eating quite some foods (especially sugary, possibly processed), pains or trembling in the left leg (although the trembling is less of a physical act, but more of a perceived thing where I feel it inside, but I can't see it happening or feel it by touching it), running out of breath quickly and possibly some other stuff that I can't recall.

With all these things, I want to ask- how do you resolve this? Especially people that have dealt with these issues, how did you make sense of the situation, what were the ways that you've dealt with them and resolved these problems?   


I'm looking forward to go to my clinic and ask my doctor to redirect me to the related specialists in order to make blood tests and receive some guidance on how to exactly deal with these things, but I also want to find out as much as I can on my own on what are the sources of the problem, how they work and what are actionable steps to overcoming this.",keto,1

Week 1 I lost 6 pounds (assume its water)
End of week 2 Ive gained exactly 1 pound.

B- Black tea w 1/4 cup ultra filtered fairlife milk
L @3pm  is a lettuce wrapped Cheese BLT with 1 slice marble cheese, 6 ready crisp bacon slices( equals 180 calories and 2 net carbs) plus 1 tbsp diced hot house tomato and 1 tbsp full fat mayo 

Dinner has been lettuce wrapped beyond burger with 1 slice marble cheese, 1 slice tomato, 1 tbsp mayo, 1 pickle slice, mustard, 1 tbsp sugar free ketchup. 

Or  Stefano alfredo sauce (0.2 cup) w 1/2 medium zucchini spiralized and 13 frozen medium prawns cooked and 1 rbsp diced tomato on top with 30 grams mozza grated at home  

Or 100 grams chicken breast chunks with 0.25 cup alfredo sauce and 85 grams broccoli florrets with 30 grams mozza cheese. 

Or 9 chicken wings( drummett and wingette to equal 1 full wing) seasoned with 2 tbsp g. hughes wing sauce.

Or 100 grams chicken breast in a salad with iceberg lettuce, 1 tbsp diced tomato, 2 tbsp diced red onion 30 grams grated marble cheese, 2 slices ready crisp bacon and 3 tbsp litehouse garden veggie dip(1 net per tbsp) thinned put with some water and 1 tbsp mayo added to it. 

Snacks are ""Kiss My Keto gummy fish"". I eat one package every 3 days. Or I have a package of jack links bacon jerky or I have 1/4 of a bar or chocolove sugar free chocolate mint bar or 1/2 lilys chocolate hazelnut chocolate bar or 1 slim fast keto chocolate peppermint cup(no maltitol..only erithrytol and stevia sweetened 1 net carb per cup). Or Eves Black sesame flaxseed crackers (1/2 bag 0.5 net carbs)

and then at night I have 1 mug of black tea with 1/4 cup fairlife milk (1.5 net carbs) 

I only allow myself 1 snack per day and stick to 2 meals per day. ""Lunch and Dinner"". I fast from 11pm till 3pm making it 16 hours. I have not added in workouts yet.Starting to do that today.

I had WLS to reduce the size of my stomach (VSG) in 2013 but got put on an antidepressant that messes with blood sugar and metabolism.

I was only able to eat 500-600 calories for a year so i sont know if it messed metabolism but if i eat more than 1500 i gain weight very easily.

Im just at a loss of what to do? Last time I did Keto, i ate a ton of lilys chocolate and made a ton of keto almond flour based desserts and highly processed meats and lost weight so easily.

p67pt9,Just looking for general advice for my current keto diet/work out,"Starting weight: 211LB  
Height: 6ft  
Gender: Male  
Target weight: 165LB

Just started keto 2 1/2 weeks ago - Went through the whoosh weight loss (around 10lb), and been steady at around 200 LB - 199.4 LB for the past 5 days.   


Current diet consist of:   
Fasting from 9PM - 1PM (Morning coffee)  
1 PM :  3 Eggs, 5 jumbo shrimp, mixed green salad, 1 cup of baby spinach, and SOMETIMES 3 cuts of flank steak  
6-7PM (usually after workout): 10oz ribeye steak, 2 tbsp of butter, 2 tbsp of EVOO, 1tbsp of ground pepper, 2tbsp of kosher salt, 1tbsp of salted butter, 3 cloves of garlic and 1 cup of mixed veggies.  
If I don't work out, I eat an 8oz ribeye instead.   


I've been going to the gym 4/5 days a week depending on how sore I am (10 minutes of cardio, 50-60 minutes of weight lifting). Weigh lifting just consists of 3 sets of 10/12 reps targeting similar muscle groups. 

I try not to have any cheat days but I've eaten out twice (dates with the fiancé). Still try to eat little to no carbs by just ordering steak/chicken with side of veggies.

I understand that some people plateau around week 2-3 while the body is getting accustomed to the Keto diet and around a month is when I should see small increments of weight loss weekly - but does anyone have any tips on what I can be doing better? Anything I should add/take away from my diet? Any workout advice?

Resting Metabolic Rate(RMR) lowering in response to calorie restriction, eating a reduced calorie diet for an extended period of time lowers ones RMR, there are a few studies that support the statement.

So my question is...

While on keto, if you run on a calorie deficit, and your in ketosis I assume your fat reserves that are now available and readily usable makes up the deficit? If this is the case, anyone have a video that might explain it...

p63jl5,Keto and reduced joint pain,"So...a year ago I (46, F) began a keto diet to lose weight. I had recently been diagnosed with papillary thyroid cancer and had a total thyroidectomy. This had caused weight gain even though I was eating a healthy-ish diet. I needed to do something, so I tried keto. I lost about 30 lbs in a couple months. I felt GREAT. It truly was amazing. I noticed I had no more joint pain. I thought it was from the weight loss. Typically, my feet would hurt when I would get out of bed and I limped around until they ""warmed up."" I also suffered from frequent knee and hip pain. It had disappeared as well. I chalked it up to weight loss.

One year later...A super-stressful school year (I'm a teacher) got me off track. I gained back some weight (not all of it) and noticed the daily joint/foot pain had returned. I decided it's time to go back to keto--probably for good (I hope). Honestly, I felt better in every way when I ate minimal carbs. After just a week, my joint pain has once again subsided. I can't chalk it up to weight loss because I've not lost much yet. I did some googling, and there are some studies that keto/low-carb eating can reduce joint inflammation and pain. WOW!! Now there's no chance I'll go back to a regular diet. It is truly miraculous to me. I never imagined I could find a way to eliminate my joint pain through my diet. 

Has anyone else had similar effects from the keto diet?",keto,1

Once yesterday and once this morning. It must be related to keto cause I when i went away for the weekend I ate whatever I wanted the diarrhea and nausea went away. I'm thinking I'm not eating enough produce i realised I dont eat it very much. I'm also experiencing muscle cramps which I have never gotten the first go. Has anyone gone through this?",keto,1
p62a5r,The Ketogenic Diet would literally kill me.,"So I started to get into keto a while back, reading about it and watching some videos. The whole idea behind it I really liked. I mainly just wanted to see how life would be if I would be burning ketones instead of glucose (or at least in a different ratio). Having more energy and a shaper mind enticed me. My weight was already good, so I didn't want to use it to lose weight. Just for the energy and the other benefits it would give.

So I started about a month ago. I transitioned fairly quickly into the Keto diet. I tried to do it as healthy as possible, so mostly vegetables, avocados, coconut, other low carb fruits, olive/avocado/coconut oils,  nuts, fish and meat.

I had a lot more energy in the beginning days, but exercise at the level I did before wasn't possible anymore. Not enough glucose. But I knew this would change if I would get fat adapted eventually.

Mental clarity was enormous improved. But it could also be the initial excitement of this new experiment. 

But I was losing weight fast. At first I thought it was just the water I lost, I read about this happening in the first few days. But I kept losing weight. And all I lost was fat. And I didn't have a lot of fat to start with, so this wasn't a good thing. 

So I added more daily calories. My calorie intake was normally around 2000, but I raised it to 2500-2750 hoping that I would regain the lost fat. But this did not happen. I kept losing weight. I didn't get it. I was eating more than I used to, and my body starting to resist it. I started to get nauseous when thinking about high fat food, or food at all.

So I started to think, maybe some people are unable to convert fat into body fat? I did a little research, and well, this turns out to be the case. I couldn't find much, but there was one research that reached that exact conclusion. It turns out there is a gene that prevents the creation of the MGAT2 enzyme. This particular enzyme basically can turn fat into body fat. More about that here: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3151692/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3151692/)

Regardless if this specifically is the case for me (which is highly likely, as I never gained much weight regardless of how much I ate) I had to stop eating Keto. 

So I'm adding carbs slowly again as my main source of calories. But I've learned a ton about diet and energy and how this all works. I still won't eat grains, it seems like they cause the most energy problems for me. So probably more fruit and high carb vegetables from now on.

TL;DR: I did keto, but lost weight even when eating more calories a day than I used to. Turns out I have a gene that prevents me from turning fat into fat.",keto,1

I started at 196 pounds (28.7 BMI) and drop to 180 pounds (26.4 BMI). I do not even know from where that weight came off. My stomach is still fat, my legs are still fat. And my face is not too different. The only place I notice some fat lose is the area around my neck which is not a place I care that much about. Besides the not-so-great results in terms of weight loss, it has been good in terms of “mental health.” I can stay awake and exercise for longer. And overall, it is easy lifestyle to maintain. Unfortunately, I am breaking it since I will be taking Accutane. Also, any tips to avoid wanting back sugary drinks? I stop drinking soda few  weeks before doing keto.

p5xjot,Keto Made Simple?,"Hey all,

Lazy? Bad at planning? Scared to fuck it up? Call me what you will, all I know is I need help to get started.

I guess I’ll tell y’all my backstory so you understand where I’m coming from and make my request at the end.

I’m 26/M/5’5/CW:236 lbs and I’ve always been at least a little chubby. I’ve had two notable peaks in my weight, right after high school (230lbs), and right now about 2 years since I finished with undergrad. Between that time period, a mix of regular exercise and intermittent fasting brought my weight down to 180. I didn’t do keto back then because I lived at home through college, and it was incredibly difficult to control my own diet while living under the same roof as my culinarily gifted mother. So I chose to control what I could: when to eat which worked pretty well for me. However this fell apart after reaching the workforce, as my stressful job and life in general whittled away at my willpower. After graduation, I gained weight at what seemed like double the rate that I lost it during college, and now I’m fatter than ever. The first few months after noticing this, I tried a half-brained version of keto (cut carbs completely, eat basically just steak/pork/chicken and greens) but not seeing results and afraid I wasn’t calculating macros correctly, I gave up as my weight continued to skyrocket.

Right now I’m at another big life change, about to head to a new city, and am getting serious about losing weight again, but I’m afraid of flubbing keto like I did not so long ago and having the opposite effect.

I’m a man that works well with regimens. I have superhuman levels of willpower and concentration if given something to start with, but most keto resources online are too vague, they do a good job explaining what keto is and how it works, but almost no organized diet plans exist in the places I’ve looked. So I look to you, **Oh r/keto, would you be willing to share a diet plan with me that you think would work for my body?** My goals right now are to get back to the progress I made in undergrad, and maybe *then* think about bulking muscle. 

Sorry if these kinds of requests are frowned upon in this sub, I’m clearly very new here.",keto,1

p5wd70,I've been having horrible sleep issues and I desperately need to know if any of you have had anything like this going on...,"So I've lost 60lbs in the last 8 months, 34 in the last three since going full keto and actually it's been around 2months. I was going to the gym every other day but have become obsessive and now go 7 days a week and am going harder and harder sweating bullets for 60 min on the tread mixed in the weights...

In the last month or so I have this thing where I wake after not even an hour and I have a jittery feeling right in my breast bone and it's an awful feeling. At that point I'm up and when I try to lay back down that feeling just gets worse...So I'm at a breaking point as there's no way I've gotten more than 6hrs in the last 5 days...

One thing I noticed is that my blood pressure meds are still at the dose of when I was 60lbs heavier and add in the exercise and I then checked my BP today when it woke me up again and it was 98/49 w' pulse of 62 this was as I woke and sat up on the bedside so it was perhaps even lower...

So I didn't take any of my BP med today and not my beta blocker either and it's still really on the low side. Then I thought it might be that I'm lacking salt as I've drastically reduced my salt intake and sweat like a madman everyday...

So I started this off just doing intermittent fasting of 19/5 but then went to one meal a day and it was usually 4/5 egg omelet with sausage/bacon cheese ... I do drink a gatorade zero once a day at the gym...but it only has like 15% of daily sodium and then I do a normal shake of salt on my omelettes....

I'm wondering if anyone has had that jittery feeling in their chest that wakes them up..it's not there when I fall asleep and once I'm up it lingers for long hours and keeps me from going back to sleep as I know it'll get worse when lying down...

I'm losing weight consistently and all I want is to get more sleep even if it's just 4-6hrs...so put salt in capsules and took four a few hrs ago and I still feel this way....I realize that it could just take more time......I'm also wondering if when you go to keto if you should do away with the IF portion and eat a normal 3x day keto meals...?  

I'm hoping someone out there has experienced this exact thing and can tell me something cuz my body is just drained....and I will say that I'm taking the next few days off the gym but am considering reverting back to a more controlled diet that has complex carbs for these days...

please help!!!   lol I know I'll be ok cuz the weird thing is in spite of almost no sleep I still am able to go hard at the gym for 90min a day....any advice is appreciated...",keto,1

In the mornings, I usually have BP Coffee or matcha tea and something very high fat with little to no carbs. One thing that I find confusing though, is that in some mornings I feel tons of energy after my bulletproof drink and fat bomb, and on other days I don't feel anything. Why is that? 

Another thing is I find it hard to know when my energy drops are coming from a lack of sleep or lack of ketone production, because one thing noticed is that my energy in most cases starts in the mornings, decreases slightly later in the day (This could probably be related to my insufficient sleep more than ketosis though), and then might pick up again later in the day. 

So today for instance, I felt pretty run down during the middle of the day due to lack of sleep, but suddenly my energy came back later in the day. Could this boost in energy somehow be related to ketones or is it related to the confusing way our body's energy goes through phrases that's more related to sleep?",keto,1

Long time lurker - first time posting (I think - ha!) 

This post is mainly for me for accountability. I went on vacation last week. First time in over two years. I did not deny myself anything and enjoyed it all. This alone wouldn't have been bad since I walked so much and normally, it wouldn't have made much of a difference, I think. I've had times where on Keto, I've indulged to jump right back into the swing of things to not feel any lasting effects of carbs. 

The problem?

Being back home on vacation (four days at home) before going back to work.

The chips, the bread, the wine, the snacks, lack of water...list goes on &amp; on.

I jumped on the scale today and I was 174 (before vacation I was 168lbs - 5'3 F)

I am determined to drink water, get back to basics and I know what I need to do to accomplish this. It's just hard when my body is craving junk and my eyes just want to close. 

I know what's next - the headaches, the stomach aches &amp; nausea but I am hoping it won't last too long or be too bad. What do you guys usually do to help you get back on track - any suggestions?

p5al8l,"Ways to obtain a healthy, fresh variety of keto food for the culinarily challenged?","Hi!

We all have our weaknesses, and cooking is mine.

I've been interested in keto for a while. So far, I mostly choose keto snacks or desserts instead of carb-tastic options. I'd like to do more, but I continue to hit a road block because I can't cook.

To clarify: I *can't* cook. I have a fully equipped kitchen, am able-bodied, can easily buy whatever ingredients I need, but I literally do not have the attention span necessary to develop more than a few basic cooking skills. Waiting or prepping isn't an option - because my brain won't let it happen.

I have left half-prepped ingredients for weekly meals on the counter for hours. In college, I left eggs to boil on the stove overnight because I forgot to turn the stove off. Timers get turned off and a ""yep, I'll get it later"". I have to reread recipes far too many times just to discern tsp from tbsp, and I miss crucial parts of instructions so things don't come out right.

**But** I can make an amazing omelet. Heat up the pan, get the stuff from the fridge, get it done, the end. I've known the recipe since childhood, very little prep, very little waiting for the food to do whatever, very little time for my mind to think of something else more interesting that I *forgot to do so just give me a minute and I'll be right back*.

Anyway, most keto things that sound delicious, work for my dietary limitations, and are not insanely costly prepackaged snacks are like a Level 20 Cooking Pinterest recipe to me. This leads me back to eating crappy food.

tl;dr So I'm writing to ask if anyone has any other options to obtain healthy, fresh keto food?

I've tried Sated, but it got boring quickly. I've tried a few meal delivery services (the reheat-it-in-the-microwave kind) and they've somehow confused ""keto"" with ""flavorless"" or they have very limited meal choices. I'm considering using a charcuterie subscription service, but I'm concerned for similar reasons.

I now know that I'll eat unhealthy foods simply out of sheer desperation for variety.

Obviously there is no need to bore you with all the positives and even the fairly common negatives. What I do want to write about a few of the more uncommon issues. 
In my pre-keto days, I used to be a regular at  my neighborhood coffee shop and pizzeria. Dare I say they almost know my by my name and as I took to keto, the first things to go are the lattes and pizzas. Add to it the intermittent fasting, and you almost never get a chance to patronise them.

This is the message that was left by my doctor today after my bloodwork came in last night. I started all of this shenanigans at the beginning of May, and have lost a total of 53 pounds so far! I am a type one diabetic who has had different ups and downs when it comes to my diet and relationship with food. five years ago I ended up in the hospital after going into organ failure, and that was the beginning of a very tough road for me in the year following. I was hospitalized for two months on around the clock antibiotics because of sepsis, ended drastically took a toll on my body… Kidneys, nerves, and my retinas. I ended up losing the last of my vision a year and a half after this hospital stay from one detachment, and the other being fully covered by scar tissue after they had to cut a quarter of it out, and have had to experience a hard reset on almost every aspect of my life. since losing my vision, I’ve gone through the stages of grief and depression, and have also overcame those steps on the way to meeting my significant other, and making the leap into becoming vegan with her help. I know that word is not very popular on this diet and sub, but it has changed my life for the better after everything that I have been through. One of the most common misconceptions is that I cannot get protein, or at least a sufficient amount of it, but this is where my kidneys come into play. I have to take reduced amounts of protein because of them, so the diet is great for me and I feel amazing on it. I am lucky to be able to experience ketosis by staying under 50 g of net carbs. I am now going to college, and making a better life for myself to ensure that I live as long as I can to say thanks to all of the beautiful people that are in my life. My hemoglobin A1C at the beginning of May was at over 9%, and it’s now down to 6%! It is part of my trajectory and where I want to go, but still have a lot of work to do. I started at 308 pounds at my appointment in May, and weighed in at 255 yesterday. I am a 33 year old male and 6‘2“ tall. I want to get down to about 210 and see how I feel there because I carry my weight a lot differently than most. I will never be thin, but I can be healthy!   If I can do it, anyone can!

p4weeh,Keto Dilemma: Low Electrolytes or Hypoglycemia?,"Greetings everyone. 

So I've been doing keto for almost two years now and fell in love with it as my health improved drastically. I am not sure what was exactly wrong with me before as I was never properly diagnosed but I had extreme brain fog, chronic fatigue, blurred vision, anxiety/depression, panic attacks, headaches, chest pain/tightening, dry flaky skin on face and scalp, erectile dysfunction, and the list goes on. I suspect I was prediabetic as is with a lot of Americans but I was never tested for it. 98% of those symptoms has been reversed on keto however, so I never really cared about it until recently. 

So I've noticed that the longer I am in ketosis, the more severe my body's response to a cheat meal will be. I always felt like crap whenever I had carbs but the last two times I got kicked out of ketosis was pretty bad, the last being the worse one yet. The one before the last time was due to me drinking some alcohol with family members. I came down with something that felt like a flu the following week. I had a headache/fever, nausea, diarrhea, and was bed ridden. I got significantly better the next day but noticed I developed some chronic low level nausea after that point, which I could not for some reason get rid of. I used to take supplements like vitamin D3 + K2, B1, and B12 every morning but on an empty stomach. I thought it could be the vitamins that was giving me nausea and it seemed to have stopped. But I can't know for sure what the cause was for sure. Also, I've been making sure to take my electrolytes since the beginning of my keto journey. I took 1/4-1/2 tsp of unrefined salt mixed with water everyday, magnesium at night time and I would get most of my potassium from food like meat and veggies. It seemed to have worked okay for me. I know the electrolyte requirements are much higher than that in the FAQ but I don't know, it was fine for me at the time.   


Anyway, last week, I guess had one too many watermelons. I was also snacking a lot on keto-friendly snacks as well, the sweet kind. Although on the label it says it has 1-2 net carbs but sometimes these labels can be inaccurate. The point is, I think I got kicked out again. Last week on Wednesday, I was woken up by a strong stomachache (this has never happened to me before), which caused me to go to the bathroom immediately. It was diarrhea and after I finished, I felt so nauseous I ended up throwing up as well although not much. Then I found myself having to go to the bathroom every 30 minutes or so. I started getting a severe headache, which then became a fever (temp was at 101). So I thought I had come down with a bad flu this time. But again like last time, all of these symptoms went away the very next day. In retrospect, I think it was due to keto flu caused by severe dehydration and electrolyte imbalance. As I was stabilizing, I noticed my chronic nausea disappeared but then I was experiencing something new, my arms and leg felt weak like power was being drain from it; I just felt off.   


Then last Saturday, the weak feeling became worse and I got very dizzy and lightheaded. I felt like I was going to faint or just drop to the ground; it was the scariest feeling and I was panicking since I did not know what was happening to me. I somehow thought of grabbing some salt and putting it in my mouth. I also had a couple of pieces of fruit to see if it was due to the lack of carbs. 10-15 minutes later, I felt normal again. Unfortunately, this has been happening more frequently. I ended up going to the ER on Friday because I thought I was going to die. I did the same thing, took a bunch of salt and put it in my mouth but it did not seem to work this time. I then ate some fruits again then took myself to the hospital. While waiting for the doc, I noticed I was feeling much better. I ended up waiting for up to five hours and nobody came to see me so I left as I was still in the middle of the queue with a bunch of people. They probably put me on the bottom of the priority list.   


So now I am trying to figure out if the problem is caused by lack of electrolytes or if it is hypoglycemia. I've placed an order for a glucose monitor and it should arrive later tonight but there's no way of me knowing this for sure. I am talking to a couple of people about this, a ND, holistic coach, and going to set an appointment with my PCP. I took a stool and blood test two weeks ago for the chronic nausea I was having. My stool test came back and it turns out I'm positive for H. Pylori. I am not sure if this is the reason why I am having such a hard time with carbs but I was told my gut biome is really messed up. I've also been told to stop doing keto for now, I am not sure why though. I would assume keto is ideal for gut infection as most of these bacteria feed off sugar/carbs. So I don't know what to do. I know how beneficial keto is, which is why I don't want to stop but if this doesn't resolve for some reason, I am afraid I might have to. Maybe Paleo would be a better option for me.   


If anyone had similar experiences and was able to solve the issue please share. I am kind of desperate for help right now. It's been hellish for the last two months.

I would get up , go to work (Some parts of my job required me to be on site to do them) then coming home and making a Keto breakfast, Working till lunch, Cardio on lunch break, Keto Lunch, then finish my day before Keto dinner. 

I started on Memorial Day and by my birthday in August i was down 50 lbs. (300 lbs to 250 lbs). I was eventually allowed to go back to work and decided to stop doing Keto and switch to a simple, healthy diet (Chicken, Broccoli, Fresh Fruits) But over the holidays my eating habits got pretty bad and i ended up gaining back 60 lbs. 

Needless to say i was not happy. I decided to start again but i need some advice. 

Basically i need suggestions on how to properly change diets once i have reached my goal. My ultimate goal is to be down to about 220 lbs. but i can't imagine gaining all the weight back again (and i don't want to) .

Abstain from carbs so the body goes into ketosis and uses fat to tuen into ketones as its fuel source. This is a great way to lose weight if that's your goal. So why would I add fat to my diet when I already have plenty that I want burned. Wouldn't weight loss happen faster if one abstained from fat as well?",keto,1

p4i06l,Broke my plateau!,"Hello all,

I've seen a few posts recently about plateaus. So I thought I would let everyone know how I recently broke mine.

When I started keto it was experimental. I had been diagnosed with GERD at 28 and didn't want to take a pill every day for the rest of my life for it. I found a few peer reviewed scientific articles that suggested up to 80% of people with GERD find relief on a keto diet within 1 week. I have a grandpa who passed away from esophageal cancer due to GERD so my motivation was NOT to lose weight, just slow my stomach acid situation and hopefully prevent esophageal cancer.

I've been Keto for just over a year now. I've lost 30-35 lbs and I feel great! No more acid issues! Most of that weight loss was in the first 7 months of my diet and then I plateaued. I continued to eat the same and continued to get 15,000-18,000 steps per day though. Like I said, it wasn't about the weight. But I was curious as to why it suddenly stopped. I'm not large but I do still have what I call my ""wobbly bits"" (my husband hates that I say that lol) so I know I COULD lose more. So I decided to download Carb manager just to see where I was at in my daily routine.

Turns out, I'm typically hitting my carb and calorie intake but I'm not even close on my fat requirements. I started adding tablespoons of cream cheese, avocado and sour cream to everything and cooking with extra butter to see how that affected my body. 1 week later... I'm 5 lbs down! 
Now, before I get attacked over this it is important to note that I get plenty of veggies every day. I've had all of my blood work done, I'm very very healthy. 

Anyways, to anyone plateauing, consider downloading an app to help you see if you are hitting your macros!

I've been doing Keto for quite some time now. I've lost over 70 pounds with it! Very proud of that one.

I also combine Keto with Intermittent Fasting &amp; OMAD for even better results, which have shown when I compare how I look now versus back then.

The thing is, in the initial stages of Keto, my hunger would be very, very minimal until 8 PM at the very least.

Now, the slimmer I got, the hungrier? I could usually last until 8 PM without eating anything, then have one big meal, then fast again. Rinse and repeat.

So, been keto for a year now.   


Started off by drinking around 5 grams of salt (not sodium), with 3 grams LoSalt + 200MG magnesium citrate powder in a 1.5L bottle. Spreading drinking the whole bottle during the day. Worked my way to 12 grams of granulized sea salt, 4 grams of LoSalt and 300 grams of Magnesium (powder).  


Is this 12g Sea Salt + 4 grams LoSalt in a 1.5 litre bottle too much? I usually spend about 8 hours drinking it. On top of that, I still salt my foods, a lot.   


When I exercise, like swimming laps, walking-trips, I might even drink 2 of them. With the 2nd bottle with HALF the measurements of the first one.   


I don't ONLY drink this during the day; I also drink stuff like carbonated water and stuff. But the ketoade bottles are simply to help give me my minimum salt requirements. Kinda like a reference point to let me know I'm ingesting enough. Am I, though? Or too much?  


Just heard someone talk about how dangerous it actually is? About how NoSalt is poison (I use LoSalt) and that one should only get potassium from foods.   


Anybody able to help me out on this matter?  


Thank you all kindly.

What do I mean by active and passive?

Active insulin is where I tell the pump to give me insulin for food and to correct high blood glucose.

Passive is what the pump gives me to keep my blood glucose level. 

My other nsv: I didn't eat the treats I baked. I baked some treats for my coworkers and left some home for my partner.

When I got home from work, there were still a couple of the treats left over. I picked one up, put it against my mouth and thought ""think of the insulin"". 

Places it down and decided to make something to eat instead. 

This is my first big ""self control"" moment and I'm very proud!",keto,1

My question is regarding exercise. I recently started going to the gym and burning about 500cal everyday. 

So, if my daily calorie goal is 1800, I can either add a deficit of 500cal to that for further weight loss or consume an extra 500cal and still be within my limit. 

But what about the macros? 500cal is approximately 28% of my calorie goal, so am I allowed to increase my fat/protein intake by 28% for the day as well, or must I still stay within the set limits of the 1800?

If I'm hungry, it's very hard to find something to consume an additional 500cal when I'm already at my macro limit for the day.

p3unkl,Blood Glucose Readings?,"Hey everyone,

So I recently decided to get a glucose meter. Just wondering if anyone here is experienced here with blood glucose monitor readings.

I had done keto for a few months, finally had energy throughout the day, went off for a month (back to the Standard American diet), and decided to buy a cheap blood glucose monitor from Wal-Mart just to see how things are looking. (the reason I went keto in the first place was my extreme fatigue after eating carbs, and it came back). I had been eating higher-carb for about 4 weeks before getting the meter.

According to my meter, after a high carb meal of let's say donuts or soup and biscuits, my blood sugar will go up to 230-240 1-2 hours after eating. It's happened only 3 times that I've measured it so far, and I've had the monitor for a couple of weeks now. Sometimes it would be up at 140 or something like that. I will have fasting glucose in the 80s or 90s at times, maybe 110 max.

I recently posted a comment in an r/diabetes thread, you can see it in my history. It seems like there was some concern, and some seem to think I am definitively a diabetic due to these numbers alone. I was just wondering if you guys will be able to better interpret these results in the context of having been on a ketogenic diet recently. Could I simply have acquired physiologic glucose intolerance? I also have a little bit of mold growing in my toilet around the waterline, floaters in my eyes, other minor stuff going on.

I am back on keto and my blood sugar has been more mellow than before, seems to max out at 120. Also, my bmi is 22 and I'm fairly lean and active.

Really value this community, it has already helped me a lot just looking at past posts. I'm having trouble finding anything on this using the search function, so apologies if this has already been discussed. Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated.

I cant believe how awesome this diet is!

It is easy, delicious, and gets results.

I have never yet had an awkward moment at a restaurant or a friends house.  Whenever I get a sweet tooth, there are TONS of options. My favorite is either frozen sugar free pudding or frozen whipped heavy cream on rare occasion.

Mostly I have been a steak and veggies man but there are so many options out there.

I am lucky my doctor is supportive. He is more hoping that whatever eating lifestyle I find myself on, the end result will be a healthy relationship with food.  And so long as my numbers keep looking like this, he's like: ""Whatever you are doing, keep doing it"".

I make sure to stay under 20g, sometimes that's substantially so. I am sure I've lost a considerable amount of weight so far but haven't actually weighed myself until today, only having an idea of what I weighed a few months back. I recently made a large quantity of [fat bomb keto popsicles](https://cookinglsl.com/low-carb-keto-popsicles-recipe/) that I hope will last me a long time for when I'm low on fat. (Very close to the original recipe and at 183 calories, 14.5g fat, 5.4g carbs, 3.6g protein each, I think they're beneficial for the days I need one.) 

I'm asking whether these foods suggest that I could do with electrolyte supplements. Unfortunately I cannot get LMNT in my country (UK) without paying an insane price for imports so I'm wondering whether Powerade Zero is actually okay, or if there are good alternatives.

p3hg4o,Finally understood the logic why excess protein doesnt raise blood glucose!,"I am a Medical student (MBBS - 1st yr) and thus I tend question any fact/logic presented to me. 

Well being in the ketowagon, I know the answer was that GNG is a demand driven process not a substrate driven one. But I always kept wondering how and the sub FAQ expalantion didnt make much sense to me. Hence I was still thinking excess protein would be converted to glucose.

Amino acid metabolisim is a important topic and I kept quite revisiting it a lot of times. But , today I was studying so damn had for my finals - And Here I had an Eureka moment !! The Sub FAQ made so much sense, except it missed a key straightaway fact which would have made it complete.

There is no need to worry about ketogenic amino acids, since the name is obvious. But Glucogenic AAs were my major concern. (All proteins available for our body faill into either or both of these cateogires )


All glucogenic amino acids can be catabolized and finally end up in TCA cycle (kerbs cycle) - All the carbon skeleton of glucogenic AAs are finally intercovented into TCA intermediates and thus Pyruvate finally.

Here is where the main logic comes in.

Pyruvate has 2 options right now - Either to continue into Gluconeogenesis or Convert into acetyl CoA and enter TCA cycle again.

Converting Pyruvate into free Glucose for bloodstream ""requires"" 6 ATPS.

But Converting Pyruvate into acetyl-coa and futher metabolism of it ""yields"" 25 ATPS.

Now you may ask why does pyruvate need to be converted into glucose then ? Well there are certain cells in our body, Like our red blood cells, Soleley rely on Anaerobic oxidation of glucose ! They cant use TCA Cycle/ketone bodies for energy production. Thus glucose is their only source.

And anaerobic oxidation of glucose produces 2 ATPS only.  Clearly there is net loss of 4 ATPs.

Hence only for those special type of cells - Only on ""demand"" - Our body is gonna expend more energyy to form glucose from pyruvate. (This increased demand can be from hormonal cause like increased cortisol) 

Well rest of the time all those pyruvate are gonna be channeled into acetyl - coa to produce even more energy and drive the body.


So if you eat excess protein beyond your limit, dont worry that you will produce glucose and raise insulin, rekt your diet and purpose, etc etc. 

Those AAs are gonna be used up in TCA cycle and no way they are gonna be released as free glucose into blood unlesss there is a demand

Special mention :

Well there's catch. 

The basis of ketone body formation is shutting down the TCA cycle. 

When TCA is shutdown, they acetyl coa cannot be burned vida TCA, Instead they are channeled to form ketone bodies.

The basic difference between a low carb diet and keto diet is that - Low cab diet uses TCA cycle to burn fat, Keto diet uses Ketone bodies to burn fat - both are completelt diffetent metabolic profile.

So tooo much excess protein may not turn you into a high carb dieter, But maybe a Low cab dieter (from keto state) - But this not gonna be big concern since many dieters on the keto forum recommend you not to be very strict with ketone production , which is completely fine. Low carb diet has further major metabolic benefits compared to high carb diet.

But I personally prefer sticking with strict keto. Since the ketone bodies have antioxidative property - which in turn promotes longeivity, keto is best fast mimicking diet, and am really serious about promoting my health for a long period of time. I really wanna stay young like a 30yr old in my 60s, and so far keto, fasting, exercise and meditation are the means to achieve it !

This is a lot of info, But I hope this would help out intriguing and worrying minds like me. Peace !",keto,1
p3hd8n,"So thankful that keto has finally made me ""regular.""","On throwaway cause this is so embarrassing. I'm not exactly Keto but I am Low-Carb. I TRY to stay under 50 g Net Carbs per day, but my primary focus is eating whole, healthy foods, and getting in a lot of vegetables, different meats, all that. Some examples of meals I eat are:

Eggs and Cheese on Low Carb Tortilla, Low Carb Wrap, Chicken Salad with Cheese and Roasted Vegetables, Grilled Salmon and Veggies, Bacon and Cheesy Eggs, Steak with a Side Caesar and Roasted Vegetable, Smoked Meat, Air-Fried Wings. All tasty foods I love. 

Snacks I eat include: 
Beef Jerky, Cold Cut Chicken or Turkey, Raw Bell Peppers with Salsa, Spicy Pickles, Cheese Cubes/String Cheese, Berries, Leftover Roasted Veggies with homemade Avocado Ranch or Caesar, Iced Coffee, or a real treat is a Keto Ice Cream Bar. 

Where I go less strict is I am flexible with fruit and vegetable intake, and allow for small amounts of (homemade) Garlic Croutons, Honey/Maple, fresh Fruit Juice for marinating meats. With the portion sizes I eat, this still keeps it fairly low. I try to strictly avoid eating sandwich bread (slippery slope), pasta, breaded meats, rice, potatoes, any drinks with added sugar.

I was diagnosed &gt;15 years ago with type II ""adult onset"" diabetes as I had been up to 265 at one point; doctors did the usual ""yea sure mister, here's some pills"" routine and let me be without giving me any advice for nutrition. I had pretty much given up and just tried to eat healthy (at least, what they told me was healthy.) No one ever mentioned Keto. Fast forward to around the beginning of this year and my insurance company sent me one of these ""constant glucose meter"" devices that stays on you for 10 days and gives you updates every 5 minutes. I started looking up things and stumbled on Keto and showed my wife. She decided it was a good idea and we both did it - she has lost about 40lbs with me as well! We've adjusted to just eating Keto and I don't really care to cheat; I'm really enjoying being slimmer than I was in the last 30 years. The best part is I've actually been able to stop some of the medications I used to take because I no longer need them.

As an aside though, my job is fairly sedentary (like many nowadays with this work-from-home environment) and actually has been for 20+ years; I never got much exercise until I moved out to the country where I'm on several acres and I have to do work (mow, trim, work on garden stuff, chicken coop, tend to the pond, etc.) It's not your typical work of course but gets me outside at least. The real problem I have is that I'm still fatigued quite often. Then again, my funsicle works a whole lot better and happy mommy/daddy bedroom private time is improved significantly but that's been about the only motivation I've had lately.

I don't even really care if anyone reads or interacts with this, but I feel like if I throw this post into the void I might be able to use it as motivation to hold myself accountable when things get really hard. 

I've been on a pretty high dose of Prednisone for a little over a month now, and my doctor flat out told me that with how overweight I am and with how much the medication affects weight gain and sugar metabolism, if I didn't try to cut as many carbs as I can I'd be at serious risk to develop diabetes by the end of the summer. I was hoping at best to mitigate any weight I did gain during this period, but instead I've been losing weight fairly consistently so far! Cutting out carbs hasn't mitigated my illness like the doctor thought it might, but c'est la vie ;) That's what the Prednisone is for.

This sub has seriously been a life saver for me, because I had no idea where to start and was pretty overwhelmed by all the information out there.

So I’m new to keto (no rude comments please), and I am about 4 days in. I used to have a somewhat bad eating schedule, I’d eat a meal or day or only eat at night. Starting keto so far I’ve been eating pretty normally, eating when I’m hungry although not tracking macros or avoiding fake sugars (maltodextrin, sucralose, etc). I heard this is okay and still works and is just called lazy keto. I eat around 3 slices of bacon in the mornings and some snacks throughout the day and end with a decent sized dinner (steak, salads or cool recipes). I started at 147 and today I weighed myself after eating and saw I’m at 149. I’m a bit discouraged and not sure if it’s because I’m doing this wrong or if it’s because I weighed myself after eating or if it’s just too soon overall to judge anything. Should I be tracking my macros? Or am I doing the right thing so far?

My husband is not doing keto with me and we tend to alternate making dinner. His meals tend to have more carbs and I try to limit how much I eat when he cooks. He is a great chef and I love his meals but he is kinda judgemental when I tell him I don't want pasta or rice etc.

My food options consist of

Coffee: Starbucks espresso with heavy cream and Torani sugar free flavor syrup.

Snacks: cheese sticks, slimfast keto PB fat bombs

Veggies: brocolli, Romain lettuce, bell peppers, 

Meat: chicken breast, beef, pork, sausage

When I cook I usually always have a meat option and someone made me realize that I may be eating to much protein. That being said I am hoping you wonderful people can share your meat-less meal ideas. I don't think I want to eat salads all the time lol 

I would also love some ideas on more vegie options and ideas on how to prepare them for a delicious meal.

If I go without meat, I usually opt for some steamed brocolli and a little teriyaki sauce (not the thick stuff with the added ingredients)

My issues: one, I’m always hungry. To the point that I feel dizzy and lightheaded if I don’t eat soon after feeling hungry. And I’m already going OVER my calorie goal just about everyday. I don’t restrict myself bc that leads to binging and just feeling generally unwell. And two, I’ve been getting bad dizzy spells the past few days. My sodium intake could use some improvement but my potassium and magnesium intake are meeting requirements. 

I also am tapering off the hell drug that is Lexapro so maybe everything I’m feeling is just withdrawal and not related to keto at all.

I tried digging a bit deeper and she admitted that it’s “tolerable” in younger, “healthier” people but in older folk like me (male, 58) who have been type 2 diabetic for decades, it’s dangerous.

I didn’t have a good response to that except that it just feels wrong.  Is she right to advise against it for me in particular? 

Since starting with her 3 months ago I’ve exercised hard 2+ hours a day (Crossfit and HIIT) and ate much, much less but definitely not keto (no alcohol, refined sugars or rice or pasta etc. but too much fruit). I’ve dropped 40lbs and my A1c is 6.0, liver function is back to normal range and cholesterol/triglycerides are great - (they were all in the critically bad range after a year of lockdown and self indulgence). 

So what I’m doing is slowly working but I want to take it to the next level - I can’t exercise more or eat less so I figured keto can help me. 

I expect the first piece of advice will be to switch doctors which is fair but that’s just too difficult and fraught around here. It took me weeks to find this one and there aren’t as far as I can tell, any alternatives. 

Should I consider a keto lifestyle at my age and in my health? I figured the best way to show her it’s not dangerous is by doing it and having all my tests come back as healthy when I see her again in 3 months.

p2ptdm,"3 days into keto, felt dizzy &amp; HR erratically dropped to ~40's. Freaked out.","Hey legends,

I've done keto before but years ago to lose weight. Doing now for the mental clarity. 

Went from eating maybe 250-300g of carbs per day to 50g on day 1, 35g on day 2, and day 3 was tracking for around 35g as well. Eating a total of around 2800-3000 calories per day. 

I didn't supplement or add any extra salt or potassium to my water on any of the days. 

I would just sprinkle a pinch of salt on my food. 

My fasting blood glucose today (day 4) is right within normal range. 

So, I'm quite sure the problem was not increasing my electrolytes at all. 

I experienced feeling dizzy, went to play some overwatch on the PC for about 20min and noticed that my heart rate on my wrist watch was showing mid 40s. I saw it hit 44. This never happens for me, when I'm conscious my HR is always 60 or a bit more at rest. Never even hits 50s. So being mid 40s was definitely something. 

I wasn't aware that low electrolytes might result in feeling dizzy accompanied by having a low heart rate event? 

After I supplemented Salt and potassium and banged about 25g of honey because I didn't know what the problem was so attacked all fronts. Recovered after and HR stayed high for the rest of the afternoon (probably due to feeling anxious).

p2ndmd,Seeking advice regarding high ketone levels,"Hi there, reluctant Reddit user here! But after searching everywhere online, I'm not sure where else to turn for answers.

I'm a 38 year old man with a sedentary job. Historical unhealthy, inactive, and obese (according to BMI... I know, I know!)

My wife suggested we try keto in order to lose weight leading up to our wedding and I took to it like a duck to water.

Because people widely look down on keto as a fad diet, I was unaware of the biological science behind the diet, and I relished learning this side of things. We bought a blood strip testing machine and I tested myself once a week or so. I always fell somewhere between 1 and 2.5 which according to everything I read was ideal for ""nutritional ketosis.""

Keto went out the window come wedding day, and we spent a few months falling back into bad diet habits.

While I was happy to have lost so much weight (I'm still overweight according to BMI but I feel 1000x better about myself) and was a bit embarrassed about having put a bit back on after the relapse, the thing I really missed about keto was cognitive function. I really noticed brain fog and a lack of focus when I went back to a carb heavy diet.

So we decided to go back on keto. The first five days were absolute hell. Way worse than the first time. I used to be a heavy smoker and while that was hard, quitting sugar this time had me jonesing way harder than I ever did quitting cigarettes!

But I pushed through, I have the focus and mental clarity back, and my weight is moving in the right direction. 

Yay, right?

There's just one thing... yesterday I tested my blood ketone level and it was 4.4. I don't normally obsess about my levels and I try and stick to testing once a week at most, however, because it was so high I decided to test again today and got 6.8 😬😬😬

Googling for information on this, ALL info is directed at diabetics, and all advice is ""go to hospital ASAP.""

What I can't seem to find anywhere is explicit information regarding whether this is also a dangerously high ketone level for a non-diabetic on a keto diet.

Do I simply solve this by eating more carbs? 

Do I need to go to hospital as a non-diabetic?

I seriously feel great. Do I trust my body, or is this a red flag?

So sorry if this has been covered. I certainly don't want to add noise to the sub! But I've searched everywhere and can't find anything that refers to this specific situation.

First time I did keto a few years ago (33:  

* 8 week duration, no supplements, strict, weights 4-5 times a week. 10% caloric surplus.
* Goal was to get back into shape and I got strong very fast (was off the workout wagon for less than a year). 
* **I had crazy amounts of steady energy throughout the day**.  I did not slowly wake up each morning but instead, my eyes flew open and I rocketed out of bed like a SpaceX launch.  Late at night I would be wide away until I laid in bed for 10 minutes and slept ok.  I loved it and the strength and energy gains were why I wanted to do it again. 

This time doing keto: 

* Currently 9 weeks in. I'm not just strict, I'm dialed in, precise, and no cheat foods even tempt me. 
* I supplement high quality D3/K, creatine, magnesium, zinc, ALA, MCT oil.  
* I got strong fast again at the same rate.  Confirmed in ketosis.  
* Caloric surplus most of the time but did two weeks at a deficit to see if it changed how I felt.
* **No energy boost.** I'm sleeping about  9-10 hours each night very soundly so quality or amount of sleep is not the issue.  I have to drag myself out of bed and I'm usually not this groggy. Energy throughout the day and night is like pre-ketosis.

p2kqoh,Advice Appreciated: Losing weight but gaining body fat %.,"Hi all, I've tried keto 2 months ago and so far have been losing weight, from 85kg to 80kg (at h=180cm/Male). I run and workout alot so I burn about 2.5k to 3k cal a day. I eat around 2.2k to 2.4k per day, consisting of around 20 to 30g carbs and at least 100g of protein. 

Was &lt;17% body fat in early June, bloated to 18+% in July, and when I just measured a few minutes ago, I got absolutely devastated seeing a 2 for the first digit. All this when I am still losing weight (muscle mass probably)... I'm fact, I feel alot fatter around my tummy compared to last time. 

Anyways my diet mostly consisting of steamed/boiled chicken and salmon, steamed sausages, egg, macedamia nuts, meatballs/cheese meatballs, 99% dark chocolate, 0 carb luncheon meat, 0 carb tuna, cheese, raw butter, raw veg salad (no dressing) black coffee (no milk/creamer/sugar). Occasionally will take fried chicken, beef patty and blackberries.

I presume it is because I consume too much carbs unknowingly, perhaps misleading/fake nutritional labels, but eating say just macadamia nuts, 99% dark chocolate and steamed fish should not be too off in terms of carbs right? 

Alternatively, it could be too high protein count, but I workout so it could be justified to sustain muscle recovery? 

Perhaps my sodium count is insanely high from all those processed food like Tuna and Luncheon meat that's why my water retention is so high. But even then, I run 10km twice a week and sweat alot. I should not be losing weight while simultaneously gaining fat...

p2c3pz,[HELP] I want to get back into keto. It worked so well for me before.,"So as the title suggests, I want to get back into keto but I need some serious advice.

Backstory - about 5 or 6 years ago, I had started doing keto and had fantastic progress. I started at 385 lbs and within about a year and a half, I was down to 255. It was an amazing feeling and everyone I met would just talk about how they couldn't believe how much weight I lost, asking me how I did it, telling me how good I looked, how much younger I looked, how much happier I seemed, etc. And they were right. I felt amazing.

But then one day I fell off. I met the most amazing woman I ever met, and told her about my diet. She was really impressed and happy about it too. I then told her about what I have to eat and what I can't eat, etc. I didn't know it at the time, but I'm a very codependent person. I've had multiple therapists tell me that exact thing. So when my (now wife) tries to be supportive of my diet/lifestyle, she manages to hang on for about a month before telling me bluntly that she can't keep up with that kind of diet. She just loves things like ice cream and bread too much. Of course I try my best to find low carb substitutes for everything she says she misses eating but none of them hit the same spot for her. Not thinking anything of it, I decide that I should ease up on keto a bit so we can enjoy the occasional treat that she likes.

And that's really all it took. Within the following months, I was at 260, then 270, 280, 300, and now all these years later, I'm sitting around 340 lbs. I'm not back at my original weight (thank god) but I feel like I've fallen so far. I'm wearing 3x and 4x shirts, size 48 pants, and I'm disgusted by myself every time I look in the mirror.

Mind you, I've since married that amazing woman and she makes me happier than anyone I've ever met. I couldn't ask for a better wife.

I just want to know if anyone has had a similar experience with trying to follow a keto lifestyle while being married to someone who doesn't do keto? What advice do you have for making it work?",keto,1
p2b778,How to safely end keto,"Hi I have been on keto for the past 3 or 4 months in an attempt to reduce my lichen sclerosus from eating less carbs / sugars, recently I have been having heart palpitations and therefore thinking I will try go back to a ""normal"" diet to reduce my fat intake and also going back to eating carbs will let me know if the carbs and sugars were a trigger to my lichen sclerosus disease.

How do I safely go about transitioning away from keto in a safe manner, I'm not worried about gaining a bit of weight as I never went on keto to lose weight and am probably under weight now. Do I slowly introduce carbs whilst reducing fats or straight up cut the fats and eat none processed carbs, I want to avoid eating unnecessary fats once I am back on a carb related diet in case my heart palpitations are due to high cholesterol.

p2ai78,No more muscle cramps on keto,"Long time lurker here. First of all, thank you all for the incredible useful information and motivational stories!  

I started keto about 2 years ago. In about 3 months, I reached a normal BMI, lost the gut completely and maintained ever since. I wasn't in it for the weight loss (more for the other health benefits), so I never counted calories. During this time, I slowly transitioned to an almost carnivore diet (eggs, bacon, cheese, meat, organs and fish), but I will have the occasional vegetables and even a dessert once in a while.

Almost everything is going really well: no carb cravings, I feel really good, I sleep well, I feel like my mind is a lot sharper than before, I got rid of all of my skin issues and I no longer crave alcohol. But one problem bothered me during this time: muscle cramps. They would sneak up on me even when laying in bed, but were much more frequent and painful during exercising.

I avoided tackling the problem for quite some time (not a big fan of supplements and too lazy for bone broth), until something interesting happened. During a 2 week holiday, while constantly eating at restaurants, I fell in love with sparkling spring water (thinking back, I believe it was my body's way of letting me know what it's been missing). 

I didn't notice an immediate change, as I would still get an occasional cramp during the holiday, but something clicked in my brain after looking at the mineral composition of the bottled water. For about 2 years before, I've been drinking mostly tap water from a water filter that I have at home. I don't know how many minerals there are in there, but I'm guessing very little.

I continued buying and drinking sparkling water even after getting back home; I found a local brand (not a US resident) with 114 mg/l magnesium, 82 mg/l sodium and 311 mg/l calcium. 

It's been about 2 months now and I have not had a cramp in quite some time. None. Zero. Not even while exercising. I guess it makes sense, considering the water sources our ancestors had.

So, if cramps are troubling you, try switching to spring water for a while, see how you feel. I don't think it has to be sparkling, but this is what worked for me and has the most minerals I could find. And I also like it better than still water.

Should I continue doing the same for about 30 mins a day or should I be doing intense cardio instead and THEN focus on toning some muscle after I have lost the fat???

I’ve been following a IF diet for a long time, it’s pretty much my lifestyle at this point where i skip the breakfast and start eating at around 3-4 PM. However whenever I want to lose weight, I turn to keto. I love keto because it always minimizes the cravings. I always feel full and never feel like snacking. This time around I decided I will start weighing what I eat count calories. And I realized I’m only eating 800-1100 calories per day. I don’t feel hungry at all, though sometimes I feel a little tired. But I’m a trucker, so I don’t move much. I know the benefits of prolonged fasting. Sometimes i even skip a day of eating. So my question really is, Should I be worried that I’m eating almost half of my maintenance calories?

I loved that i could cramp &gt;2k calories in a 5hrs window and not have to worry about good for the rest of the day, comparing to my previous lifestyle, where things would enter my mouth every 2 hours.

I guess they don't call it a ""starvation mode for nothing"". My physical energy and will to do anything was gone. Absolutely nada. Tasks like cleaning my room, climbing stairs or getting of bed sometimes were horrifying. I was putting out a considerable effort just to walk.
So i started bringing carbs back, and man it helped but it sucked. I feel increasingly more vitalized but my body is paying the price. Bloating and unhappy stools everywhere. Inflammation is back too. I've been told that these are indicators that something is wrong, but something was wrong before aswell.

No help at all.

Exercise: plank and core exercises 4x a week, planning to incorporate more strength training and build more muscle

Officially down 30.8 lbs!! I started at 151.6 lbs. I got back on keto on March 25 after falling off the wagon 3 yrs ago. I was keto for 9 months and just got careless. I gained it all back plus 15 extra lbs over the next couple of years.

I was so insecure of my weight gain and hated seeing myself in the mirror. I was so bloated. Just coming to the realization of where I gained the weight killed my self esteem even more. It was bad lol. 

Also, an employee at the Container Store thought I was pregnant. I was buying a rolling tray and the guy said it’s good to store baby clothes and diapers. I never felt so horrible about myself. 

It was hard for the first week with the carb cravings, but once I got through it, it got easier. I just kept telling myself, “would you rather be healthier or do you want to stay like this?” I had a couple of cheat days scattered through, but was able to get back on track. I find my WOE more sustainable the second time around since I’m doing more high protein vs. high fat. I’m so proud of myself of making it this far! 

My goal weight is 120 lbs right now, but since I want to build more muscle, I won’t worry about the scale once I hit goal weight. 

So anyways, keto works and I feel amazing!

**What foods do you know that only have &lt;0.5g per 100g of sugar and carbs?**

The only foods I know that fit that criteria and I eat are :

Spinach, Mushrooms, Eggs, Salmon, Prawns, Soya yogurt(0 sugar,0 carbs)

I will also have small quantities of :

Sauerkraut (2% carbs), Kale (1% carbs), Oat milk (5% carbs) 

Also I could eat some meats and chicken. I've cut out all dairy.

Pretty boring diet but I've lost weight and my scalp acne disappears until I accidently eat something with sugar or carbs. I've been eating like this for about 5 months now. All the inflammation in my body seems to have gone as well.

I realised that carbs get converted to sugar so had to restrict my oat milk (0 sugar but 5% carbs)

Would be nice if there were more foods that I haven't discovered yet.

My scalp acne appears to be an autoimmune problem like seborrheic dermatitis, but I'm still not 100% sure what it is. I was eating low sugar protein bars before I got it, so it could be related to artificial sweeteners.

I'm sure lots of people will be concerned that I am not getting a balanced diet. I have been feeling a bit dizzy and have heart palps so just started eating more salt and need to get a potassium supplement.

I've got a natural multi vitamin but it probably contains sugar so not taken many so far.

Also need to get my blood checked every few months probably.

p20ufs,"Need external goal, met the one driving me in Keto","I have a personality disorder, that makes me REALLY not care. I cant set internal goals and i have no passion to do so. It's so bad, that i often feel like i'm not even real, or living my life, and it's just impossible for me to set goals because i want something--because i DONT want things, and, the concept of 'I' can even get a little grey for me.   


So i set out on keto with an external goal set, my DR set me the goal to lose 15 in 90. She was a keto sceptic at the time, and not down with keto at all, calling it a fad diet. So, i lost 15, and then kept going, hoping to arrive with some sort of weight loss to shock her a little.   


I arrived, 85 days into the diet, 90 from the last appointment, 42lbs down (336 to 294). In the 90 days, she had indeed done a ton of work of her understanding of keto. I was happy, she even knew the difference, this time, between low carb, and keto--and didn't assume that either were a 'fad' of butter and bacon. I told her the loss outloud, she had a shocked face that was what i hoped to achieve--and checked her charts to confirm, and said it was incredible, impressive, and that it was done in 90 days, was quite amazing. She told me to be proud of myself for it (thanks personality disorder, i'm not sure i am, but i SAID i am anyway). to 'keep going' ... that's it.   


So--now i'm left without a goal. She doesnt need to see me for another year. There's no goal. A vague 'keep it up' is not going to work for my personality type. I need EXTERNAL goals, a type of accountability that's hard to get without someone that'll actually be disappointed on the other side of it, or a metric that will disappoint ME on the other side of it when i have to tell someone.   


What can i use to set the next external goal? I think the farthest out i can tolerate in my brain is Christmas, as a goal--maybe only thanks giving. I know i cant sustain the pace of loss in my first 85 days (half a lb a day), so what should it be?   


How do i set myself up, into an externally accountable goal, or deadline, etc, that i can use for motivation (something i lack due to a personality disorder)?

- pulled pork BBQ with a Carolina mustard/vinegar based sauce (again, no modifications, there's a little honey in there but 3g net carbs) and collard greens

p1yr1i,Simple ham steak recipe :),"I’ve been experimenting with some different ingredients to make these ham steaks a little more enjoyable. To be fair, I do generally enjoy them already, however the flavor gets boring after a while. This recipe is keto friendly Ofcourse! 

Ingredients:
• 1/2 Large ham steak
• Yellow mustard of your choosing
• Natural butter
• Black pepper
• Himalayan pink salt
• Garlic powder
   - May substitute for crushed garlic

Optional:
• Crushed red pepper
    - Or chili powder

Recipe:

• Set a medium pan on the stove top, at medium heat. Add a fair amount of butter, the amount will depend on personal taste and fat content of your ham.
• While the butter melts, add about 2 Tbsp of yellow mustard into a small bowl. Season to taste, generally if you’re using garlic powder I’d suggest adding a little more than you’d think is enough. Then mix.
• Now that our mustard/spice blend is mixed, brush one side of your steak with about half of the container. Carefully place the steak into the pan, mustard side down into the melted butter. (Be gentle here as to not wipe off your seasoning. Cover the top of the steak with the rest of your mustard mixture.
• I like to cook this steak nice and slow with minimal char. At this point you may adjust the temperature according to how you like it. I do recommend that you only flip the steak 1 time to minimize seasoning loss.

I like to plate my ham steaks with a portion of blue cheese dressing. If you are like me, and would like to try this; please do not use cheap dressing. Kraft or similar might ruin the taste of your beautifully cooked ham. Shop for creamy dressing, in the climate controlled section of your local grocery store (by the lettuce/salads)

This seems like a wildly unhealthy diet and it probably won't work, but when I talked to her about this she refuted that claim by pointing out the fact that she's still eating vegetables, she works out regularly, she's technically on a caloric deficit since she's only eating ~1200 calories a day, and that she'll still be able to enter ketosis as she's usually eating less than 10 grams of carbs per day (or on some days, literally 0). I don't know shit about nutrition so I didn't really have a counter to this, so I'm honestly curious as to if she has a point? Can she lose weight like this? Is this at all healthy?

I started keto after a family wedding weekend in St. Louis where I absolutely destroyed everything I ate, from BBQ sides to a massive piece of cheesecake from the Cheesecake Factory, I drove home with my wife after and felt absolutely disgusted. I was 410lbs at that point (Memorial Day weekend), we had just had our son in early April, and it was at that moment I decided I had had enough. Since then, I am down ~45 lbs in basically 2 months and I can already see and feel the difference. My knees and feet, which would kill me going up and down the stairs, don't hurt as much if at all. My jeans (size 50) are falling off unless I synch them up as tight as possible. I even escaped 2 weeks of vacation and our county fair without gaining any weight.

There's a product that's been advertised pretty heavily called 'Lumen', and it's got a decent value proposition. It says it can monitor your metabolic rate and more importantly also whether you're currently running on carbohydrates or fat. Reviews are quite favourable, but it just seems too good to be true, especially because it operates more like a breathalyzer than anything else.

'Keyto' is very similar; it just doesn't measure metabolic rate.

p1oc93,Weight loss," 

If you’re overweight, you are not a bad person. You’re simply overweight. But it’s important to lose the extra pounds so you’ll look good, feel healthier and develop a sense of pride and self-esteem. Once you’ve lost the fat, you’ll need to maintain your weight.

Most Americans pack on those extra pounds by eating the wrong things. Changing these poor eating habits is the key to long-term success. Knowledge – along with the right food – is the key.

You can never get rid of fat cells, but – unfortunately – you can add to them. Depending upon what you eat, your body will manufacture new far cells. And like those you were born with, they never go away. That doesn’t mean you’re doomed to be fat once you put on extra pounds. It is possible to shrink fat cells. That’s what happens when you lose weight. You burn up the fat stored in those big fat cells. Think of them as balloons. Burning off the fat inside them has the save effect as letting the air out of a balloon.

A good weight loss program requires a certain amount of intake restriction – the consumption of fewer calories. You burn off the fat by eating less fat and becoming more active.

p1hebi,My Journey so Far (35 M),"Back in 2020 I weighed in at easily 360lbs (163kg). I'm 6'4"" (192 cm). Then in March 2021 I went to the doctor for a physical and basic labs. To no one but my surprise, I was essentially diabetic (a1c 6.4, diabetes starts at 6.5), liver enzymes growing higher than ever, and for the 1st time ever I had high cholesterol. I was formally diagnosed with metabolic syndrome. Was told to start a ketogenic diet. 

First off I always thought it was fake, the body *needs* carbs to function. Ketosis meant, to me, uncontrolled diabetes. I learned the difference between ketoacidosis and ketosis. But those numbers were scary and eye opening. So I buckled down and started working on me. I was put on metformin along with medication I had taken since I was in my early 20s.

I started slow like my doctor said took about 3 weeks to get below 30g/day. Was told not to go lower without talking to them. I never went through ""keto flu"" I felt more energized and active. I was missing sweets, and still do, but found some safer alternatives. I also started working out in earnest. 1st month lost 20lbs (~10kg), 2nd was down another 10lbs (4.5kg). Now 5 months in I've lost a total of 80lb!  Recent labs showed my a1c is 4.8 (normal), liver enzymes falling and almost in normal range, cholesterol is almost back to normal. 

Did I have slip ups? Absolutely! I graduated college and took a break, and gained weight during month 3. Went to a wedding and lost self control. No weight gain there just knocked off track and out of ketosis for a week. My husband will make fun of me for not being able to eat anywhere or taking the bun off a burger. 

It really sunk in how far I've come when I bought a new tank top. I was barely fitting in a 3XL back at the beginning of the year, and now fit comfortably in an XL. I still want to lose up to another 60lbs (27kg). Will be happy with half that. I'm also no longer morbidly obese, just obese. 

For people on the fence, not sure if they can do it, or think it is fake. It works, you can, and it is real. Will try and upload progress pics. I also weigh less now than I did at my wedding 4 years ago. I hope to keep the weight off. I lost 100lbs in my early 20s and kept most of it off for 5 years. I am doing it again!

I also do intermittent fasting (16/8). This is actually the toughest for me as I get hungry in between and want to snack. When I hit a plateau, intermittent fasting helped me break it. 

To overcome the slight hunger, until I train my body, I actually use a mantra that I say to myself that helps me get through it easier.

It's actually funny since I am stealing this mantra from an old ridiculous tween ""thinspiration"" website. I laughed when I first heard it, but it actually helps me and is true in my mind.

My NSVs are the belt I bought to wear with a dress for a wedding this past weekend did not fit even on the tightest notch. When I ordered it I had ordered the plus size version of the belt because I was worried it wouldn’t fit. Now I have a super cute new belt that I will need to leather pinch extra holes into. I also put on a pair of shorts this weekend that I could barely squeeze on right before the 4th of July. I put them on last weekend and was shocked that they were completely loose around the entire waistband. 

I’d say We are tough critics of ourselves and sometimes it can be very very hard to see a change in the mirror especially when you first start keto but clearly something is going right with non scale victories. I’m truly excited for when my family can start noticing a change. This lifestyle change has given me a lot of confidence and is helping me heal my messed up relationship with food.

Anyway, I have never successfully combined keto with running. Whenever I try I just loose all energy, my legs feel like lead and I get really slow. Since I aim at longer distances (half marathon and upwards) it would be fantastic to be able to run fat-adopted and not have to worry about glycogen.
I went for an easy 5k today having switched to a pretty relaxed keto regimen since Friday (I’m not in ketosis) and had a truly horrible experience.
Anyone me out there that have experience with running fat-adopted? How long did it take you to get there? We’re you able to get back to your old glycogen-fueled times or should I expect to be slower on fat? Times really doesn’t matter much.

p10xwu,Keto related nausea?,"Male,  56. About 4 years ago, I cut out refined sugar, drastically lowered by  carb intake, and went from 178 in July 2017 to 164 in July 2018. That  may not sound like much, but I've always been ""skinny"", weighing 118  when I graduated from High School in 1983. At my 30 year reunion, my  friends and I joked that everybody gained 60 pounds since, it just  didn't show on me. I show my weight in my face, my arms and wrists and  my waist, in my twenties, I burned calories like a furnace and could eat  EVERYTHING and not gain an ounce. Middle age changed that, so losing  those 10 pounds was a major thing for me.

My  problem is I also travel a lot for work (or did before COVID) and while  away, I stuck to my diet but felt nauseous in between meals. I felt fine  while eating (I had to make myself eat sometimes) and afterwards, but  the nausea would return. Always. Once I was home, I felt fine again. I  spent a week in Disneyworld with my family (we moved down to Florida in  2018) and still felt nauseous. A two hour trip home and I felt fine  again. I've spoken with my gastroenterologist, my doctor, and even a  therapist,  and the closest any of them every came was I had a travel  anxiety (Again, before COVID). I made sure to mention it to my GE before  an upper/lower GI, so he knew to look. Perfectly normal and even the  biopsy showed nothing. I have GERD (physical reasons, not stress) and  take Prilosec, so I know to watch for GI stuff.

COVID  hit and all my weight loss went out the window along with my job.  Stress eating, I went back up to almost 188 and my waist to... Let's  just say 38 and holding. After 10 months of firing off resumes at a rate  of 5+ a day and nothing, things started picking up in June and last  week 5 recruiters contacted ME. Time to make sure I can fit into my nice  clothes again, so in early July I cut out processed sugar, cut back on  carbs (not off), and went from 183 to 176 at the lowest (178 this  morning). And, sure enough, the other day I felt nauseous.

What's going on?

I  do have a goal and I'm keeping it very simple, low 170's and fit into my  36"" jeans. That's it. I'm trying to keep active, but it's not easy with  with COVID (In Florida) and the absurd heat and humidity we're having  right now. I \*have\* to limit my outdoor activities or I'll drop from the  heat, it's no joke, younger guys than me are going to the ER with heat  exhaustion right now.

My  ""diet"" is no processed sugar (coffee and oat milk only), salads, few  carbs (a sandwich every now and then), no alcohol, no sweets except for a  square of dark chocolate in the evening. My snacks are oranges (I love  Clementines), grapes, and a nut/wasabi pea/raisin/Dark Chocolate M&amp;M  trail mix I keep at my desk. Aside from my morning coffee, I only drink  water and have for the past 15+ years. No sodas. I treat myself  occasionally with a 3/4 unsweetened 1/4 sweet tea at Chick-fil-a  occasionally.

The  other evening, I treated myself to a cookie bar so big I cut it in half  and then cut it in half again. I ate only half of that and put the rest  away. That night, I felt like I was going to throw up all night and I'm  pretty sure it was the massive jolt of sugar. 

Sorry  about the length, apparently I had more to get off my chest than I  thought. Up until a few weeks ago, I'd never heard of the keto flu even  though I'd searched for it ever since I first felt nauseous.

I have a question that may be a bit dumb, but I can't quite seem to find an answer as it relates to keto. So the past 2 months or so, I am finally at a weight where I can jog/run again after being too heavy/uncomfortable for the past 4+ years, I know exercise does not drive weight loss to be clear, but I truly enjoy the way it feels.

I am in a situation where I am sedentary almost all times if I am not doing little things around the house, hence why I love the treadmill so much.

I am currently doing 2 - 45 minute sessions: 1in the am  and 1 in pm at a moderate 4.5 mph pace. I am making sure to supplement electrolytes per the faq, and pretty much drinking water all day, other than that I feel great every time I run/jog.

Could doing this say 6 days a week lead to anything negative in the long run in your opinion? I don't see my doctor for a few months to discuss with her, but I am healthy and have good blood pressure readings, no pain in the lower extremities/muscles used for running etc.

p0y5b2,HELP! Why is keto not working??? Is cortisol really a thing?,"Hi all,

**Background info:** Female, 23, 166cm/ 5""5 and 70kg/ 155lbs (BUT 59kg/ 130 lbs pre-pandemic).

I've been on the keto diet once before, a few years back, and I lost a fair bit of weight. Today marks one month on the keto diet in an attempt to lose the ""lockdown weight"". I've only lost about 1.5kg/ 3 lbs since starting a month ago, and this is probably water weight.

I've been weighing and tracking everything I consume on Carb Manager and my net-carbs were below 20g for the first two weeks and thereafter below 13g for the past two weeks. I'm staying away from all artificial and sugar alcohols. I've been sticking to my IF (17:7) regimen and incorporated fasted cardio. My daily calories have been around 1300. 

**I've been so dedicated and consistent, why am I not losing weight? Is there something I am not considering? I am really beyond disheartened.**

People always say that high cortisol, meaning stress, inhibit weight loss. I've never really taken this seriously because I'm too pragmatic- if the numbers add up (both in terms of calories and macros) and I have all my supporting strategies (fasted cardio, IF) in place, my state of mind should be irrelevant? **Can anyone comment on the stress/ keto interaction?**",keto,1

I tried keto (with intermittent fasting) because I wanted to reduce inflammation and feel healthier in general…also to reduce COVID fat and gain more muscle again.

I'm very careful with what I eat, making sure there is a perfect ratio of good fats, protein and lots of vegetables. I am aware of oxalates in food and avoid those, and drink lemon water on a daily basis (and quite frankly getting tired of it). 

Has anybody else experienced this side effect of keto? I don't necessarily want to stop, but I'm starting to feel I may have to. It could be the uric acid built up in my body which can occur with ketones in the body.

128g protein
160g fat
26g net carbs
2,000 calories

I can easily meet these. But must I meet them at all? Can I do less or should I strive to be exact? If I have a day with 8-10 carbs, is that fine as long as the ratios are 75:20:5? 




OK! A few years ago I hit the biggest I've ever been. I'm a 6'2"" male. 34 years old, and a mechanic who hikes aND walks aND hunts and fishes most of the year, so I'd say moderately active. HOWEVER, I love food aND I don't ever get full. This men's 5,000 calorie days can be the norm at times. 

Now, I ws 270lbs and disgusted with myself. It was time for a change, so I began to severely cut back on quantity of food. I figured it would be easier to stick with to change one thing rather than an entirely new lifestyle all at once. I went down to 220 in a few year time which brings us to about two months ago where I plateued. No change in anything but quantity of food, and I didn't measure anything , just the less. 

I haven't been able to shake this holding pattern for two months, and actually went up to 230, so the wife and I decided to do keto. She was going to anyway so I tagged along. 

I'm doing well this first week, food Is good, diet is varied and 's clean as I can get it for the most part. I'm down to 220 again.

So ok, cheating is not recommended on the keto diet ... but if you need it, if your brain tells you that you need it, that you need to take a breath then you need it.

Besides, in my case it's pretty funny: I ate my big macdo without guilt, telling me ""you invest to stay sane"" and in the end, even if I had fun .. . I was a little disgusted with carbs. Following my cheat day, I drastically lowered my quantity of carbs. This good big meal made me so tired and physically disturbed that it didn't make me want to start over.

But I had to experience it.

p0ko8g,NSV/SV: I somehow survived a trip to France!,"Hi folks! Just had a very nice SV/NSV this morning and just had to share with this community!

My work/life means I usually travel a LOT, though obviously I haven't been traveling for the last two years. I started keto about two months ago and knew I had a 2-week trip to France coming up. The thought filled me with a mixture of excitement and dread.

Travel has always messed up my eating habits. I can get into healthy habits at home, but as soon as I hit the road, a mixture of stress and excitement for new food means I forego all these hard-earned eating habits. Prepping for my trip to France, though, I felt like this could work this time.

And it did.

**My goals going in**

Before leaving on my trip, I set three simple goals for myself:

1. Stick to ""lazy keto,"" i.e. don't count calories, but make keto choices;
2. Eat in a way that you won't gain weight on the trip (with losing weight as a stretch goal);
3. Enjoy French food!

I can say that I had partial success on issue #1, success on #2, and success on #3.

**What worked**

This may surprise some, but it really wasn't hard to make ""lazy keto"" choices in France. France is the land of the entrecôte and the tartare, so there were plenty of great meals to be had. If you know your French sauces, it's fairly easy to avoid cream-based ones, or those that are thickened using flour. For instance, [Béarnaise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9arnaise_sauce) is clarified butter and egg yolks, which is great. Mind you, if you don't drink a gallon of, say, sauce au poivre, you won't be getting a whole lot of carbs, either.

France is also fantastic for salads. They have tons of salads that come with cheeses or meat including stuff like gizzards, which are super keto friendly.

I also found that substitutions were easy. I was never charged for, say, substituting fries for a delicious salad.

I rented an Airbnb for most of my stay, which means I could bring home delicious market products like small-scale meat and fresh veggies. But I definitely went out to restaurants a lot, too.

Every time I had a keto-friendly meal, I had the satisfaction of eating healthy, AND I still had wonderful, rich, delicious food. In some ways, it even made me try stuff outside my usual go-tos, which was great.

**What didn't work so well**

For the last two days of my trip, I was in a hotel in Paris. Paris in August is shut down to an absurd degree, and finding food at noon was a hell of a challenge. I had to forfeit keto and ate croissants and baguette for breakfast/lunch (I do IF 16:8).

It was fine for one day, but on day two I felt a bit sluggish for the first time since I started keto. That jambon fromage sitting on a bench park along the Seine was amazing, though.

Also, wine. I ended up drinking a lot more wine than I usually do. I can't say I feel sorry for those $6 Bordeaux I had... If anything, I feel like they've cured me of ever wanting wine again because they won't measure up.

**Scale results**

On my first day back, I was 7 lbs over my last weigh-in before we left. That felt discouraging, but I suspected it may have been because I kicked myself out of ketosis.

Sure enough, four days later and being back on strict keto, and I'm down below my last weigh-in. Getting back on  the keto bandwagon wasn't really hard; if anything, I was craving being back on it and feeling better.

**The key lesson: there's plenty of stuff to enjoy on keto**

I think the biggest takeaway for me was not to focus on what I couldn't have (pastries, bread, croissants, etc.) and more on what was there. And what was there was fantastic! If anything, being on keto made me make choices that were both healthier, and outside my usual palette. It was a great experience.

\---

So there you have it. For the first time in my life, travel has not destroyed my diet, but instead made my travels more interesting. I wish I could have stuck with it more, but Paris itself was crazy challenging and I just had to give in.

And now that I'm back to my last weigh-in, I feel like this was just a short pause, which is fine.

And if I can make it in Paris, I can make it anywhere!

Thanks for reading!

So, what do you think? If someone was metabolically flexible, would they move in and out of ketosis once rice is used up by the body? Are non-fat adapted and metabolically flexible contestants basically in keto flu mode the whole 39 days since they don't have access to good electrolytes? Do you think their bodies fall into ketosis regardless bc they are burning through carbs before eating again?

p0h4w9,Keto &amp; Covid-19,"Last week I came down with one of those ""breakthrough"" cases of Covid 'Delta variant', even though I had gotten my vaccine shots back in January.  A relatively mild case and I am isolating at home until next week.  Symptoms included bad sinus headache, a dry cough and fatigue, and the loss of taste and smell.  I am pretty much over the symptoms and functioning normally except for the taste and smell, which I have heard can take anywhere from three weeks to several months or more.

The day I tested positive was the first day back on keto after about five months.  I had gone off it for various reasons, gained some weight back, and figured I needed to start again.  I thought it would be super easy to do keto without the ability to taste and smell, but losing those senses has made it nearly impossible.  Now everything is about texture and a hypersensitivity to the four basics -  sweet, salty, sour and bitter - and this has made eating certain foods rather difficult, and has given me almost no appetite.   I always liked eggs in any form, especially fried and scrambled, but now the texture is very noticeable and I can't eat them now.  I guess there are some advantages, for example - I hate yogurt and whey protein, but now I can make a protein shake with vast quantities of both and feel like I'm just having a flavorless ice cream shake.  Problem is that I still have that mental hang-up that tells me I'm eating something nasty.  I'm also finding that I don't want to snack because I can't taste it.  Corn chips and potato chips taste exactly the same.  

The loss of appetite has curbed any weight gain, and I'm still down almost 15 lb in the past week, but I am still wanting to take advantage of this unusual situation.

Hi all,

35, M, 5’6”, been keto for about 6 weeks.

I feel good at the moment, having some trouble with balancing electrolytes but I’m working on that. If anyone has any tips on how to manage that I’d happily take it! i.e. knowing which ones you’re deficient in and a good way to work on it :)

Some advice on how long to run in zone 2 would be appreciated too! A workout plan that won’t burn me out but would be effective, especially as I’m not fully fat adapted yet 😒

The main post is actually because although I feel good, and at a better baseline that if I weren’t keto…I’m starting to get this slight moody feeling come over me and I’m sure it’s because I’ve not been running!

I have been strength training:-

2 days a week:-
5x5 barbell squats
5x5 bench press
5x5 barbell row

1 day a week:-
5x5 barbell squats
5x5 barbell overhead press
1x5 deadlift

I have felt better and stronger doing that and have also been hitting the sauna and reaping the benefits of that if I have time…maybe once a week!

So I’m thinking of keeping the strength training for afternoons so I can do some zone 2 MAF running and cycling in the mornings. I also want to implement meditation before I go out because I’ve noticed my mind has been racing lately, I’m currently trying to expand my business so I can easily fall into a loop of overthinking in that area.

My schedule will look something like this:-

4.30 wake up and meditate
5.00 zone 2 maf running or cycling (is it ok to combine the two?, and how long should I run for? I still need energy for the day ahead…I’m only doing it for mental balance)
6.00 shower and breakfast
7.00 get on with the days proceedings!
15.00 try and finish work at this sort of time so I can get a strength session in 3 times a week
17.00 have dinner nice and early so I can sleep soundly
18.00 have the lady and doggo’s come home and have a couple of hours with them
20.00 go upstairs and wind down with a book ready to nod off at 9pm so I can get a good 7.5 hours sleep
21.00 sleep, I can’t believe I go to bed at 9pm 🤣 I used to be such a party animal!

p0692o,Ways to sneak in extra calories?,"Greetings! I've been lurking this sub for about a year now. Finally decided to take the initiative almost four weeks ago, and I feel amazing. I don't have a large amount of weight to lose (currently carrying about 15 more lbs than I want to) but I also wanted to reduce inflammation due to a health issue. 

I saw immediate results,and lost 10 lbs in the first two weeks. I then hit a plateu, and I'm guessing that's because I'm not getting enough calories. It's a major effort just to hit 1k daily, because I just don't feel like eating. Sometimes it actually makes me nauseated. Does anyone have any suggestions for increasing caloric intake, like go-to supplements or certain protein powders?

p05ljb,I think my taste buds are changing," I started Keto and IF on July 2nd at 235 currently 214. I used to drink anywhere from 6-10 cokes a day I quit cold turkey all drinks now just purified water and milk thistle/dandelion tea. On top of the diet I also switched to 80% organic food. I had some medical issues so I wasnt messing around. 

Anyways last night my fiance took me out for date night, he wanted to for weeks but i wouldnt eat out because in the beggining it's just to hard not to give in and fall off the wagon. We went to a brazilian steak house since i could basically eat meat all night which is keto friendly. For desert i decided to have my usual creme brulee since i was doing good. I always order their creme brulee. But for the first time I couldnt eat it all, I had maybe a few bites, it was just so sweet it was like a sugar bomb exploded in my mouth.

Then tonight my mom made meatloaf and some terriaki noodles which I didnt want but didnt want to hurt her feelings since she went out of her way to cook. She who made all the same changes as me July 2nd took one bite of the noodles and so did I and we looked at each other in disgust and said what changed we loved these noodles they taste like shit right now. Mind u the company could have changed something or she could have messed up the ingredients but neither one of us could take another bite.

According to https://www.virtahealth.com/faq/sodium-potassium-magnesium-ketogenic-diet the daily requirements are about:


Electrolyte | daily amount
---|---
Sodium | 3000–5000 mg
Potassium | 3000–4000 mg
Magnesium | 300–500 mg

so a reasonable *Na:K:Mg* ratio is about **10:10:1** . I assume most foods are higher in sodium so we might want to adjust the mix towards the other electolytes.

From the packaging we can see Lo-salt has 13.10g **Na** and 34.60g **K** per 100g. The weight percent of the other cations are calculated from the atomic weights (ignoring table salt additives):

Salt |	Formula	|Cation	|Cation wt%
---|---|----|----
Table salt |	NaCl |	Na | 39.34
Lo salt | mix NaCl,KCl | Na | 13.10
Lo salt | mix NaCl,KCl | K | 34.60
Epsom salt | MgSO4.7H2O | Mg | 11.12

Adjusting ratios I find that a *Table : Lo : Epsom* weight ratio of **7 : 13 : 4** gives *Na : K : Mg* weight ratios of **10.02 : 10.11 :
 1** which is pretty good. I guess you can use this mix as a condiment on food or add to water for a drink.",keto,1

Keto helped me break out of a real plateau and depression spiral. Last year I went from 213lbs to 178 lbs through regular cico and exercise. I plateaud and went up to 192 before starting keto. In the past 3 months I went down to 162. I'm now aiming to focus on strength exercises while doing keto and maintaining/dropping 0.5 lbs a week. I wouldn't have been able to do it without this subreddit and I'm a keto for lifer now.

oztaep,"1 month, 28 lb, No signs of slowing down.","Hey everyone!

SW: 307.7
CW: 279.8
GW: 250
Height: 6'3""
Age: 24

Little backstory first because my weight has done some crazy things, in high school the natural weight that I just was, was about 282 lb. That's just where I sat at for a few years, last year of high school I decided to do a victory lap and play football, my weight shot up to 315 lb, before plummeting to 235 lb over the course of maybe 3 months. And in retrospect I looked really damn good lol.

The issue though is once football was over, I was still eating the carbs and calories for football because I have very little self control. So my weight ended up went back up to 320 over the course of a year. And has fluctuated between 320 and 275 on and off over the last 4-5 years.

So I started keto on June 6th. That's when I committed to losing weight. I've tried keto before and it has worked but usually I would give up or stop seeing results after a week or two, probably when I stop losing water weight. I have seen consistent weight loss this time and I just feel like I'm in the right mindset post pandemic.

Milestones:
300 lb on June 11th
290 lb on June 22nd
280 lb on on August 7th

My BMI which I don't really follow went from 39 down to 35.5.
And my fat percentage went from 32.5 down to 30.9.
So at least according to my Fitbit scale only about half of the weight I've lost is fat. Not sure if that's normal but I know I lost quite a bit of water weight at the beginning.

My resting heart rate has also gone down by 6 BPM.

So the weight loss is slightly tapering as I lose weight, but overall I think I'm still losing weight ridiculously fast.

So for a little info on what I'm doing, I figured it might be helpful to some people or if I'm doing something really stupid, they could help me out.

So I'm trying to keep it less than 5 to 15g per day. Also doing OMAD so I only really eat between about 10 and 12:00 depending on the day and my schedule, but I only give myself one hour to eat. And I also try and keep it around 1,000 to 1200 calories a day at least according to my Fitbit.

Also according to my Fitbit a fairly normal average day for me I'll burn about 3500 to 4000 calories, if I try I can bump that up to 4500 to 5000. No idea if Fitbit is even remotely accurate. But that's just what it tells me. But I can usually average about a 2500-3000 calorie deficit. Which at least kind of makes sense with me averaging a little less than a pound a day.

I also started taking some supplements, there's a brand called NATURELO, I'm taking an omega-3 fish oil tablet, a whole food multivitamin tablet, and a extra virgin coconut oil tablet from another company.

Just because I'm bad at keeping track of my nutrients I figured especially the whole food multivitamin would kind of keep me balanced on things I need to be balanced on.

I also started doing cheat days, which are Fridays, which is also why my actual weight has varied so much. For the cheat days I try not to cheat on carbs I cheat on the OMAD, basically if it's 4:00 p.m. and I'm hungry, I'll eat a second meal for the day yesterday I had a handful of pecans. My only other sort of cheat meal thing, the quest bar birthday cake flavored keto bar things, I'm giving myself one for every 10 lb that I lose, which means today I'll be able to have one as well!! They're really low on carbs, but I'm trying to get the psychological sort of treat.

I have no idea if I'm doing horribly destructive things to my body, I feel fine, I actually feel pretty good. My only real exercise is walking, whenever it's not too hot out I'll go for an hour or two hour walk.

Other than possibly damaging my body just to how quick I'm losing weight. My only other concern is falling off the keto wagon.

OMAD I don't think would be that hard to get back on too.

But my biggest concern is having to go through the keto flu again, didn't have any keto flu this time whatsoever. I was actually worried I wasn't getting into ketosis for some reason until I started shedding water weight like crazy.

But my big worry is if maybe in a year from now if I'm still doing keto and things are going well and I pass my goal weight of 250 lb, once I hit 250 my next goal is 235 because that's what I was during football. If I keep losing weight at the rate I'm losing it I should be at that weight by the end of 2021, but even if it takes an entire year, not only will I still be happy but my concern is that I'll never be able to have anything that's really high carb ever again even as a treat.

A dairy Queen blizzard, a big mac, things like that. I don't really crave them but I'm just curious how other people deal with that sort of stuff. Like on my one year keto anniversary, if I've lost like a hundred pounds, I'm going to want a big Mac or something dumb to congratulate myself. But I don't want that to trigger a bunch of weight gain because I have trouble getting back into ketosis or something like that.

Sorry for rambling, I tend to ramble. But I figured a one month anniversary might be worth a Reddit post.",keto,1

I have a friend who went through the same thing as I did and she started on a Keto diet for approximately two weeks and got her period back. 

My question is has anyone experienced the same thing? Do you think I should go ahead and go on a Keto diet and hopefully my period comes back?",keto,1

ozozdy,"The world has become sweeter, more vibrant with flavor","For as long as I can remember, I've been addicted to sweet things. You've heard those stories about how much candy a person can eat, well I was the person they were talking about. I was skinny for a long time, but began gaining weight in my thirties. At 34 I reached 100kg. Now most people won't tell you this, but there are a surprising amount of benefits to being a bit heavy. But that's a different story for another time. It also has its drawbacks. I didn't want to get diabetes, so I decided to go low sugar a few years ago.

It was surprisingly difficult just to find food that lacks sugar. But once I got the hang of it, I found I didn't crave sugar. No, after a few days I stopped even wanting sugar. But for weeks everything seemed bland and tasteless. It was like nothing had flavor anymore, even things which had always been tasty before without sugar. But then the taste came back in full force. Things began to have more flavor than ever before. Things were sweeter than they had been before. Things you don't think of as sweet were now sweet like candy, but candy was sickeningly sweet. Cinnamon tastes sweet like sugar, grapefruits taste sweet like oranges, coffee with milk tastes sweet like hot chocolate, except in all of these cases it has a much more vibrant, more complex flavor than ever before.

I maintained the diet and stopped gaining weight, but changes in my schedule disrupted it and I gained again. I had been staying fairly low sugar and stable in weight when, a couple months ago, my mother started the Keto Diet. After some research, I became convinced to give it a try myself.

It took a while to work out meal plans and get my food sorted out, but I sort of just dove in and tried to get a day of keto at a time. Immediately my cravings shifted: I wanted more meat, and the veggies I had always loved, like zucchini, mushrooms, broccoli, I suddenly wanted them more than ever. Even when I craved starch, I no longer craved wheat and oats like before; now I craved potatoes, rice, and beans. I'd always thought maybe someday I'll switch to potatoes, rice, and beans to get healthier, but I just never realized it would be so easy.

The first day I did Keto, I got this feeling I've gotten so many times before, a feeling of weakness, which I'd always interpreted as having low blood sugar. Up until now I had always taken it as a signal to run and get some carbs, but this time I did the opposite and ate meat. The feeling came and went, and without eating carbs, I went right back to feeling normal in a matter of hours.

I was 235 pounds/107 kilograms when I started Keto. Within a week and after only two successful Keto days, I weighed myself at 226 pounds/103 kilograms. Unsure if it was just water weight loss, I hydrated myself, made sure I was eating enough salt (I tend to under-eat salt), and started weighing myself multiple times per day. I am currently about two or three weeks in, with six or seven good Keto days down (including yesterday and today) and I last weighed in at 222 pounds/101 kilograms. That can't all be water weight. I'm feeling great, my back is still inflamed but it isn't stiff anymore! Things are looking up for me!

I’m pretty much in the middle of my journey. I started in January of this year and I’m 59 pounds down, but still need to lose around 110 more.  

Getting started definitely has its own struggles, but being in the middle of it can feel difficult at times too. A lot of worrying about plateaus, fluctuations, etc. It’s not a linear process and can be frustrating at times. But hearing that quote (the title) really put in perspective that even though the week to week things you might worry about now can be frustrating, think about 3 or 5 years from now. Those fluctuations don’t matter, what matters is you did it. And you’ll be so glad you did.

Even now I couldn’t be happier, I feel motivated as ever, and I’ve worked really hard to build discipline and self-esteem that was completely non-existent this time last year.

You are all amazing, never stop posting, and you lurking people, please share your stories as well! Any post may as well be the one that motivates the next person's journey.  
  
I restarted Keto after a rough remote studying year. I was ~131kg before it went remote, and when it ended I weighed 143.5kg. I had lost all my progress I had made during early Autumn semester of studying face-to-face. I felt really devastated. I didn't land a summer job either, despite countless applications. Despite feeling awful about myself, that turned out to be the greatest gift of all, a whole summer of freetime to focus on my health.  
  
I have learned an incredible amount about Keto, nutrition, dangers of sugar &amp; seedoils, about diabetes &amp; metabolic syndrome, about macro- &amp; micronutrients and the list goes on. And with this information I've gathered over two months, I know for a fact that I am never returning to a high carb way of life.  
  
I have lost 13.5kg (30lbs) within two months. I learned that fat is less dense than water (correct me if I am wrong!), so I've lost over 13 *litres of volume*. Let alone the carrying weight.

oza3s6,2 Years On Keto / Hypothyroidism Issues,"Hey!

So I have been on keto for 2 years now lost 110lbs in the first year went from 330-220 and then in the 2nd year I think I got a little too lazy with my calorie counting and ended up eating closer to maintenance because I have gained back 20lbs and have not been able to lose weight since even eating around 20-25% deficit which for me is 1650-1750 calories a day. 

While figuring out if my calories have been closer to maintenance I also had thyroid blood work done twice and on each occasion my TSH was high at 5.94 mU/L ( range of 0.27-4.2 ) and T4 was low at 12 pmol/L ( range of 12-22 ) so I figured I was hypo and started taking 25mcg of Synthroid last week but it makes me feel terrible basically hyper on such a small dose. 

I guess my question is since I have been eating under 20 net carbs a day for 2 years have I sort of messed up my thyroid function? I have read about T3 issues with a lack of carbs so maybe my body isn't converting the T4 properly which is making me feel anxious as I have too much when I take the meds. I feel as though I still have a good amount of weight to lose around 70lbs even but I am struggling to lose anything anymore even at a deficit. 

Just trying to figure out if I have kind of peaked for weight loss on keto or changed something chemically in my body that just doesn't want to comply anymore with losing weight if that makes sense. I just feel like something is wrong with me but I don't know if its keto / thyroid related or something else but I figured I would be further along by now in my weight loss.

I battled my weight my whole life, spending it starving with hunger pangs or constantly dieting. If I'd only known my low-fat high-carb way of eating was the thing doing me in!!!  
I then put on weight during menopause thirty + pounds between the ages of forty-five and fifty-five. I was desperate when I hit around 155 lbs. After that, I stopped weighing myself.  I heard about intermittent fasting. Since I was used to starving myself (at one point routinely only eating 600 calories per day, which totally messed up my metabolism, I tried that instead. Four pounds came off and I felt a little better. I then discovered keto around 151 lbs. That sped up the process and I was able to FINALLY take the weight off eating normal calories around 1,200 -1,400 a day. I was thrilled!   


I was no longer hungry, two meals a  day filled me up and I was starting to look like the way I wanted.

But it also said I need to lower my salt intake and and eat healthy foods like fruit and while grains. All of that is pretty much opposite of Keto, considering you cant eat any grains and very little fruit, as well as adding more salt/sodium to the diet.



I was planning to start Keto a couple weeks after my 2nd shot. But now I'm wondering if trying to lose weight with keto while having blood pressure issues is maybe a bad idea?",keto,1

SW: 270

CW: 180

Height: 6' 2""

Age: 22

After 1 year on keto, I have finally hit 180. I want everyone to know that you can do it.  I love food.  I mean LOVE LOVE food.  Especially desserts. And definitely going on a lifestyle change was difficult.  But change is difficult.  One thing for sure is that this change will make your life that much better.  Among my friends and family, no one and I mean NO ONE would have thought that I would be capable of this.  It all starts within you.

 My journey consisted of different periods of experimenting with clean keto, dirty keto, and OMAD while trying to incorporate some form of exercise at least 5 days of the week.  I think it is important to find what works for you.   Remember, keto isn't simply a diet.  It's a lifestyle change.   What worked for me was a mixture of clean + dirty keto incorporated with fasting.  This resulted in 25 net carbs a day, drinking only water.  And yes, I  would cheat on very limited occasions such as drinking or indulging in dessert.  But I think it's important to incorporate these days in order to make keto more lasting.

I hope this motivates someone out there to continue working hard.  I believe in you.

oyqd2w,Sloppy Keto NSV,"So I did Keto in the past, and lost 120 lbs. Sadly, I fell off the wagon and gained all that back plus more over the following 4 years. Right now I don't know how much I weigh, I'm over what my scale will read. The last time I was weighed at the doctor's office I was 423 lbs. I know I gained more weight after that, but don't know how much.

I've realized I don't have the mental strength to do keto the way I used to. I was married and was cooking for both of us, and made a lot of delicious keto meals. Now I'm divorced and living alone. I don't have the motivation to cook anything, much less the more hands-on keto meals. I basically live out of cans now, and don't have much appetite (thank you Adderall) so eating the same thing every day has been easy. I eat a can of tuna for lunch, and a small tub of cottage cheese for dinner, and other than a few keto-friendly snacks from time to time that's about it.

My NSV comes in the way of clothes. At one point I was so big I couldn't fit into anything besides an old pair of gym shorts. Then I got to a point where I could fit into my jeans if I was laying down, then fit into them standing, then easily fit into them standing and the tightest hole in my belt.

Yesterday was another NSV with a pair of shorts I bought earlier this year. They never fit, but they seemed high quality, so I figured I'd keep them around. I fit into them yesterday, and I'm so excited to go out with friends and family and enjoy the weather while summer is still here!

Someday I'll get down to being able to see my weight on that scale, and that will be a big win. Until then these wardrobe related victories will have to do!

Today I picked up some dehydrated green bean “chips” (just crunchy, dried green beans) without reading the nutrition facts since I couldn’t see the teeny-tiny writing on them. When I got home, I used my phone’s magnifier and realized these things have 21 carbs (4 fiber) in a 1-cup serving! Considering they are roughly the same size as regular green beans, and green beans only have around 7-8 carbs per cup, with the same 4-ish fiber, why are the “chips” SOOOO much higher in carbs? I mean, I understand that cooking can convert starches to sugar, but… this seems crazy.

The ingredients are green beans, tapioca starch (which does have a lot of carbs, 28 in 1/3 cup), canola oil and salt. Now, I’m quite certain these green beans don’t have nearly 1/3 cup of tapioca starch in a cup, because they’re just actual dehydrated (or fried) green beans, so I am guessing the tapioca starch is to keep them from sticking together, or getting damp, or maybe just for flavor? So where in the heck did that many carbs come from?

oym8z2,Good experience with a Registered Dietitian who's on the keto-friendly spectrum -- they do online appointments,"

TL; DR - if you want the phone number/website for a mainly keto-friendly registered dietitian, I believe the one I went to also does fully online consultations. PM me if you'd like the name. It's located in Ohio, US.


I wanted to share my experience at my initial appointment with an RD who's keto friendly(ish).


After my most recent blood draw, me and my fDoc agreed I'd see an RD instead of him recommending any supplements. Now that I'm determined to be long-term keto, I want to do it in a way that works long term for my body. He hesitated to diagnose any specific deficiencies as I already had the appointment set up with the RD (he admitted without prompting that the RD would be better for it, since he said himself he had next to no training in nutrition), but I can read numbers and can see I'm deficient at least in iron, zinc, vitamin D. Even though I track intake using Cronometer, and I know I exceed RDAs for those, I'm still low. Perhaps it's because I don't have a gallbladder. The RD has ordered more blood tests to test all minerals and markers of deficiency.


I brought a food log of my last couple weeks to get some initial recommendations while we wait for the additional blood tests. I thought I'd share my experience. I think I eat a fairly reasonable keto diet recommended around here, I eat some packaged keto products, but really not much. Mainly meat and vegetables, some scotch, some keto wraps/bread. Then sometimes snacks like Quest protein cookies. So let's give me a 9/10 for meals &amp; snacks that are whole foods.


She was happy with my protein and Omega 3 intake (I already use fish oil pills). She said she prefers to make incremental suggestions towards different intake. I suspect she'll want to do something about my ""high"" LDLs. But before that, she'd said want a NMR test to confirm whether I have the beneficial LDLs or the more ugly kind. My alcohol intake is probably something she doesn't recommend either. But like with LDLs, she didn't make any recommendations on it at this visit. I only drink one 5oz caffeinated coffee today, and I suspect if I drank more she'd suggest to drink less caffeinated coffee.


She recommended a digestive enzyme for me, so I could have in particular the ox bile to help with absorption of nutrients. Based on my intake, she also recommended trying to replace splenda and other sweeteners with stevia -- she admitted it's hard to eliminate them completely since they are often added to keto products. But I promised to do my absolute best. She recommended some products (replacement for mio and cola/soda) similar to things I already ate, which was super helpful. I'm not a huge fan of complying with this, but I promised a 6 month trial.


I have a degenerative retina disorder. She recommended some supplements to help slow that. Called my eye specialist afterwards to confirm, and he cleared this.


The practice uses an app to ask questions in a chat, which is fine and expected with her. She also fields questions/clarifications via email. (I have a sneaky suspicion she'll eventually try to convince me to quit keto, but I'm not sure she will if we can get my nutrition where it needs to be for vitamins/minerals.


I doubt my experience is very different from what everyone here would experience. She did slightly push a fancy analysis that costs $300 if you're into that kind of thing that includes lots of analysis. But if you're not into it, the regular blood tests your doctor might run are ok too. She also said they had a body composition analyzer if I was interest, but I'd mentioned I was getting a DEXA to check my bone density (due to some recent fractured bones) so she requested that when it comes in.


Long story short, it seems like she's keto-ok. If you want the name of the practice, please IM me. I'm also open to answering any questions I didn't think of via PM or any time in the future on this thread.",keto,1

We flew cross country last week for a family wedding. 1 connection. 2 flights. Trusty seat belt extension both times.


**Fast Forward** to yesterday... Flying home on our last flight I had forgotten to grab the extension out of my carry on and thought I'd try the standard buckle before asking people to move. NOT ONLY DID THAT SHIT FIT, BUT I COULD WRENCH DOWN ON IT TO MAKE IT SNUG.

I've been on and off keto for years but this February it clicked and I'm down over fifty pounds since. Previously, if I had gone over on my carbs I would take it as an ultimate failure and back slide for months. This time I accept that carbs are gonna happen but the goal is to not get discouraged and just start the next day over on the right foot. KCKO really is the ticket! Can't wait to see what the next six months unfolds as I add some fasting and more rigorous exercise! Thanks for reading everyone. Y'all really are an amazing community!!",keto,1

oykp1t,How does carageenan affect you?,"I am devout daily coffee and cream drinker. 

 35%mf cream has recently become available in town and doesn't have carageenan in it and my digestive system feels great.   I had wondered this for years.  I think this cream proves it really is the carageenan.  Unless the factor is different cows and processing?  How you all feel about carageenan?  Has anybody else singled it out as problematic? 

1.  I found cream without it on holidays once.  Felt great the entire week.  Was also on holidays so thought maybe the relaxation factor was part of it.

2.  18 percent table cream does not have carageenan, feels better on my digestive system, but does add to my carb count.  It's amazing how 3g of carbs changes what I can eat for the rest of the day. 

3.  Always feel sick to my stomach after eating any sour cream, cream cheese, yogurt, with carageenan, but not without.  But eat it so infrequently I wasn't sure that was the factor.   Guar gum, xantham gum, don't seem to make that specific feeling of nausea but not quite nausea, it's hard to describe.",keto,1
oyknc6,How low can I go on fat ?,"Hey everyone.

&amp;#x200B;

I made a keto diet a year ago, worked wonders. I decided to go back to it a few weeks ago.

My question is, how low can I go on fat ?

I'm a 25 years old 1m75 male, I do weight lifting 3 times a week.

I was thinking about dropping to about 40 to 60g of fat. On an average day, this would make me drop around 1000/1100kcal.

&amp;#x200B;

Of course, if I feel hungry, I'll up my fat intake, but I haven't felt hunger for a few days so sometimes I just feel like I eat ""because I have to"". So, I started wondering, how much do I actually have to eat ? If I can get away with 1000kcal and still not loose strength or feel tired, that seems okay, but I prefer having a second opinion first.

&amp;#x200B;

Additional info, I take multivitamins and Omega 3 supplements, my current macros are 20g carbs, 170g protein, 85g fat, totaling at 1525 kcal.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks a lot in advance, have a wonderful day.",keto,1
oyklzf,Keto Diet Tracker. Excel sheet,"TLDR: Excel sheet to track keto percentages.

Disclaimer:by no means am I a nutritionist, I am using this diet strictly to lose weight quickly, I'm just a fat boy with a dream of wanting more for my life haha.

Friend of mine sent me this excel sheet that tracks keto percentages by inputting grams of F (fat), P (protein), C (carbs.)  I put in a couple examples on one of the days to show how it works. You will need to change dates etc but I made it easy. AMA if you need help. I started on a thursday so scroll to the right for the first week or start on second row, sorry im trash at excel to fix this.

It has been so helpful for me I thought I needed to share it to the world. I was 243 pounds 5'10, used to be 200 pounds before I began eating my emotions haha. Now at day 27 I have lost 21 pounds with limited exercise (a 30 min bike ride, a 30 min workout, and swimming in the ocean for a couple of days, no other working out since I started.)

I know I need to begin working out/sauna an average of 2 days and my weight will fly off, looking to join a gym. Please post any questions, I have great momentum with meals I truly enjoy. Not to say it isn't hard but I have suffered from overeating and being so unhappy with myself for years and I am just starting to succeed. You can do it! 

I also try to do at least 12 hours of fasting from dinner to breakfast but I'm not great at it.

(PLEASE DONT COMPARE WEIGHT LOSS IF IT ISN'T AS MUCH AS MINE, WE ARE ALL DIFFERENT BUT THIS WORKS FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE, NOT ALL.)

My goal is to lose 50 pounds then switch to a more paleo lifestyle.

Biggest tips for starters: buy 1 cup and 1 tbsp measurers (measurers idk what they fuckin call it haha.) I didn't care about my totals this whole time, I just tried to get fat to 70% which I averaged more around 57% the first two weeks now more at mid 60%'s.

For fats: Avocados, Extra virgin olive oil (get the nice stuff), Coconut Oil, Mayo, Merrigold Butter (its so fuckin tasty and fatty baby.)

Veggies with little carbs: kale, spinach (love it in an omelette with obscene amounts of butter.) Great to just throw in tuna/egg/chicken salad.  

Struggles for me: eating too much protein then having to make up for it with fats at the end of the night. Not being able to eat a lot of vegetables First week is harddddd, you feel like shit but then I felt great.

I will feel a little hungry but not that sugar crash hunger. I had Covid in December, 2020 and have had lasting fatigue and brain fog and both have improved already.

The interesting thing is I had done a DNA genetic test with health screen and Keto (Or LCHF specifically) was the recommended way to eat for my DNA so I figured I would give it a try. I can honestly say this is the easiest weight loss plan I have tried. I am lucky in that I didn't drink soda or have a sweet tooth and love spinach and other carb friendly veggies.

oya2ul,"Question about Medical THC, CBD, and Keto","Brief background...  I played minor league hockey (very minor lol) for about 5 years, played for 25 overall, tore my body up, and now here I am at 50 after having 17 surgeries all hockey related, and my two knees need to be replaced in a couple years. Two of my surgeries involved cutting out bone (AC Joint resection in both shoulders) and I consider those my 10 on a 1-10 scale of pain  

Today...  As a result of tearing up my body back then and needing knee replacements I constantly live in a level 6 state of pain daily. Bad days it spikes to an 7-8 and the worst days a 9.  I went through a period of taking opioids for the pain, but with long term chronic pain it is too easy to fall into an opioid addiction. The only thing that helps with the pain now is medicinal THC  

I loathe smoking and edibles contain way too much sugar. So I have resorted to making my own infused organic coconut oil and filling capsules to take orally. I've researched a lot about THC &amp; CBD and their effects on pain management and I utilize micro-dosing when I am in pain, usually more in the evenings as the end of the day my knees are pretty trashed.  

There are not a lot of peer-reviewed medical journal studies on THC &amp; CBD to begin with and even fewer regarding how they interact with Keto.  So does anyone have any real experience with THC/CBD and Keto? In theory since both help as an anti-inflammatory, they should work together to provide decent pain relief. I am only 3 days into this Keto cycle and I didn't use THC/CBD in the last one.

This past week, I broke through a plateau I was in for several weeks due to recalculating macros, being really strict about the fat as a limit rule, and micromanaging my relationship with the food scale. Feels great!

I understand now that the fat as a limit rule is the most important (at least for me) and I simply won’t lose unless I stay at or under fat (even if I keep carbs very low and stay under calories). 

Day to day, my current macros feel much lower than the last time I calculated (around 175lbs) and I’m finding it harder to eat my full calories while still limiting fat and feeling full. 

I think I need some new menu items that are more on the leaner side so I don’t blow a big portion of my fat budget before I’m able to feel full and satisfied with a decent meal. I also thought about eating to a 10% deficit instead, but I’m not sure I want to risk it yet! 

Have others felt this? Does anyone have any tips for getting through those last, hard, 15-20 pounds? Any good food recommendations?

oy4bc2,"Back on keto after a tough year, and the biggest things I've learned.","I'm someone who you can call a yo-yo dieter. I've dieted for around 20 months over the last 4 years-- keto, 1200 calories, and different variations.

This wasn't in the plan, but after a mad financial struggle and some issues with perfectionism, I learned some things that might help you diet successfully. Hopefully they'll generate some discussion, disagreement, and other perspectives.

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Don't do sugar free, sugar substitutes, or semi-sweet sauces, even occasionally**. Whether it's that sweetener in your coffee, a diet Coke, or a tiny bit of Chick Fil A sauce (even if it fits your calories), I've found over and over again that when I include them even occasionally, it creates cravings that wouldn't have existed otherwise. When I don't do them, I stop wanting them at all. You might find the same.
2. **Cheat days, or cheat meals, are mostly overrated-- they don't affect speed, but they do affect cravings.** My most successful dieting happened when I completely skipped the cheats. Post cheat-- weekly for example-- I'll feel hungrier and crave things for the next couple days and spend the rest of the week looking forward to the next cheat. However, if you need to cheat, I've found that a weekly cheat meal gives you the best of both worlds, and it didn't slow down my fat loss. Comparing 6 months of no-cheat dieting with 6 months of weekly-cheat-meal dieting, I was able to lose weight just as fast-- 10 pounds a month-- as not cheating at all. The difference? No cravings and I didn't think about the diet as much. It's easier to accept this new healthy way of feating when you don't create as much whiplash
3. **Keto unavoidably creates lasting cravings for months after the diet.** I was never one to crave sweets, but for 4-6 months after every time I did keto, I would have huge cravings for sweets. It's something that's making me think differently about this diet. However, I still hugely believe in keto if you have a ton of weight to lose, like. I did in the beginning. Keto helped me simplify enough to make sticking to the diet easy, and it made me confident for the first time that I *can* lose weight. This time, I'm doing keto + black beans, basically a variation of the slow carb diet with keto-level restrictions. The beans are meant to help with cravings since I'm still getting enough carbs daily. I hope this addresses withdrawals after I'm done with this diet, and creates a path to lifestyle &gt; diet (""I am a person who eats healthy.""

&amp;#x200B;

*Note on 1 and 2:* If you're tempted to try eliminating cheats and sugar substitutes, I highly recommend you do it at the start of the diet. I've found that that's when I have the most motivation and it's easier to set a higher bar at the beginning and slip later than to start it easy. You might find it does make things easier with fewer cravings! And if you don't, adding them later won't punish your progress.",keto,1

oy3pvs,Tried Colonic Hydrotherapy on Keto - heres my results + AMA," Hi guys! I have a graph of my high weight before I started my keto/carnivore diet. I was up at 262.4

After 3 weeks of eating keto I’m down 14 pounds. I had one cheat day, which stalled my weight loss almost 4 days but then rapid weight loss again.

I’ve generally considered colonic hydrotherapy in the past, but decided that cleaning out my gut just to keep eating crap doesn’t sound useful. I also wondered if anyone on the keto/carnivore diet had tried it, but couldn’t find any anecdotal evidence at all .... so I decided to take the plunge and let you all know what happened (or ... take the insertion I suppose!)

The tl/dr is basically that colonic hydrotherapy felt “pointless” since I had already de-bloated, cleaned out the colon, and flattened my stomach with carnivore alone

But if you’re curious like I was, I’ll give you a rundown and would be happy to answer questions.

The assumed benefits of the colonic are to clean out the colon, but may hurt your electrolytes or gut biome. I had been told, almost like a boogeyman “there could have been ancient pieces of feces stuck to the side of your colon for ... who knows, decades?” One major criticism is that if you keep eating poorly, you re-fill your colon in a matter of hours/days.

When eating normally, this didn’t seem that helpful, but I sure was curious to be able to say at least ONCE I knew I had a clean colon. Maybe then I’d wait another 30 years and do it again.

But mentally, I was considering that during CARNIVORE this might actually be an ideal situation - clean the colon, which you are not simply refilling, make sure there are no pesky “ancient turds” in there, but also get super hydrated. I would see if there’s any truth to the stomach flattening, or immediate (normally temporary) weight loss, but in this state maybe it’s NOT temporary and it’s breaking a weight loss plateau.

The procedure itself is simple enough. You strip, get into position, they insert, you lay on your back, and then the procedure starts.

They do -not- empty your colon. In fact that’s basically impossible, and probably harmful. They don’t explore or “hunt down” these mythical ancient turds. All they do, is add water pressure to your colon... as much pressure as you can take, and when it gets to the point you can’t hold it .... they switch from blow to suck and you get that “whoosh” we’re all familiar with. They repeat this for a while.

You basically take 12 back to back water shits, except the water was just put there, and we (assume) the feces and other junk will come with.

No why do I say “we’re all familiar with this”? Because this was literally just a keto shit. The exact type of keto shit we went through naturally when starting keto/carnivore. Early on in the procedure I started to wonder if our bodies haven’t already done this process, which of course we know drops some pounds of water weight and flattens our tummies. And if so - was almost nothing going to come of this colonic?

As the procedure went on, even the technician sounded disappointed. I had told her I had been doing carnivore and didn’t know if we should expect much. Sort of in defense of her job, you could hear her skepticism and her answer of “oh you’ll be surprised how much still comes out”. Not much came out. Followed by comments like “well... to REALLY get the stuff out, you need to do several colonics let’s say by the third one I think we’ll have real results.”

In her defense, is it possible I still have ancient turds back there, and stubborn parts of my rear colon that need multiple therapies to work out? I suppose it’s possible, but I’m not going back.

The procedure was $125. I committed to it as part of my health quest, but I think this voyage needs to end.

Is a colonic useful? Maybe yes. But if you want one, eat carnivore for 4 days and you’ll get your colonic, minus 1 flaming asshole (I jest, it wasn’t a big deal, maybe just a hot pepper asshole)

Also, to be clear, the natural colonic is more thorough. Imagine your worst keto shit... the “bad one” that’s a ‘1’ on the scale.

When you were driving and made a sudden u-turn into a Denny’s parking lot because you didn’t know you had to shit, but you do NOW, and your family waits in the car. The one you had to hold for 4 minutes because a child was on the only stall, and 10 minutes later you’re back in the car and your family thinks you took a 10 minute crap ... but the crap itself was like 4.5 seconds, that’s a 2 or a 3.

The colonic shits were a 4 at best, all controlled with pressure gauges and no fear of god.

Getting colonic hydrotherapy was like a Wednesday on carnivore.

Weight loss was literally 0. I was 249.8 going in, and I was 251.2 when I got back (YEAH I weighed myself!)

No my stomach isn’t any more flat, I felt no change at all. Also no recovery or tiredness, nothing. Didn’t even feel extra hydrated.

oxic0o,back on the bandwagon,since july of last year i lost 53 lbs in 7 months using keto. i finally was under 200 for the first time in a long time. i felt great but for some reason as soon as i got under 200 i completely started messing up. i fell off the bandwagon and really started binge eating and slacking on my exercising. of course that caused me to gain about 10 of the pounds back that i lost. i have been feeling so crappy lately although i only gained 10 lbs back my body image is completely distorted and i feel like i gained it all back and i am just as big as i was when i started. for some reason i have no self control when it comes to carbs and sugar so i feel it works best for me when i cut them out almost entirely. i’ve been having no energy because of my eating habits recently and i’m just fed up if i did it before i can and will do it again!!! so i went food shopping tonight and starting tomorrow i am going to be team keto again! so pretty much i am just writing this post to vent a little and be held accountable! btw i love seeing everyone’s success stories keep it up it gives me so much motivation!,keto,1

ox7szb,Looking for Sound Advice,"Hey everyone! This is going to be a lengthy text but my questions are valid, so I hope you read until the end. I am not hear to ask professionally but to hear from the people from the community who may have discovered this before me.

I started keto when I was 18(F) 

I was 163lbs, 5’1. That weight may look to some of you like no big deal, but for my size I was extremely overweight, my back and knees hurt, no energy. I was gaining weight from a sugar addiction as well. 

Noticing patterns I began to dive into research. Finally I committed to keto and spent maybe over a hundred hour in two months collecting data how to correctly but quickly lose the weight. 

Then boom. It actually happened, I lost a ton of weight and jumped right back to 130, still over weight but I was proud. 

The confidence pulled me out of a bad relationship. I met another guy, overweight but had the same passion to be better for himself. 

I taught him all my tricks, we got married and we both hit our normal weight together.

Except I had an underlying eating disorder. A while on keto for the first few months it wasn’t apparent to me it was still there. 

You see the large weight I got too, a lot of trauma evolved around it and my own self image. At the time I had no idea how serious it was. 

Before keto, I did try to vomit and starve myself but it never worked because of the sugar addiction. I was dealing with a lot of self-hatred. A while losing weight this wasn’t a problem. 

When I hit the “great” Plateau. I discovered fasting was very useful. Quickly adapted and tweaked things to lose more weight. 


Then life and stress happened. Instead of breaking to emotionally. 
I began to fast more, and eat very less still Except I didn't realize I was still losing weight. I was too busy trying to get my life set up. 

I became borderline Anorexic and did feel myself breaking down.

So I let myself start eating more normally but it was hard. But here is the thing, I work better, faster and my mental health is good with no sugar higher fat. 

I don't have much money on me but can buy groceries for keto. 

I guess I am asking is- I love the diet is there any way I can stay on it? I only know how to get started overweight and it was easy. 

I am currently 105, maybe 110. (my scale broke.) My lowest was 100. I eat specific carbs I introduced into my diet but it is on a case by case basis.

I tried to eat an American diet too. I binged and know I just got blessed catching this addiction early on. 

For anyone concerned my parents are aware and therapist. They encourage this diet still because they saw the radical change. 

I guess my question is, how do I maintain a healthy way on a ketogenic diet? Is there any way I can keep my costs grocery $100? 

Or is it best to transition to something else?
What should I do? 
I hit my dream goal so what is next?",keto,1
ox7md2,What a difference 2.5 months makes.,"Started Keto for the second time on May 16. SW 336. CW 296.   


Some time around 310lbs, i started to fit comfortably into 3x shirts again. For anyone bigger than that, we know that means i can now go shopping in average retail establishments. IF i get to 2x, it means i can shop pretty much anywhere--so a ways to go yet.   


I've had to re-learn how to move my body while i sleep, or that i COULD move. I somehow had not noticed that i couldnt roll over properly when i was 336.   


I found out this week just how EASY it got to clean the house--a task i hated, dreaded, feared, because it was painful and exhausting. Every time i bent over i felt like a dandelion some little kid was trying to pop the head off of.   


I've gone on 6 mile bike rides with my partner, when a single mile before would have left me begging for the sweet release of death before. A few weeks of those, and we did a 6 mile, and i went out for ANOTHER one that was 10, and didnt feel even the least bit tired from it. It's inconceivable in my mind, how i went from less than a mile, to 16.   


I fit in the shower now. It's stupid, but our shower is narrow, and i was always touching one, or two sides at a time before--somehow i thought this was normal.   


I realized, 4 days ago, in the middle of the day, i hadnt even tried to do a squat yet. It's one of the exercises i used to do, and i had pretty damn powerful legs for a long time as a result, but at 336--the pressure on my knees, and my weight, kept me from doing more than 2-3 before trying to faint. I can do them now with such ease, it's almost frightening.   


The seatbelt in my car no longer gets pulled to its max limit and starts locking down like a ratchet strap holding down a water bed, because of how big around i am. I can now even lean to pick something off the floor and it doesnt go all the way out. I used to think the seatbelt was flawed/broken--nope, just me being too big around.   


I've lost as much weight, as my 4 year old weighs.   


My unmedicated blood pressure went from 157/90, to 117/85 (i have to stop taking medication for it, because it seems to only lower the systolic--making me fainty as hell--no, hydration and salt doesnt fix this, i have no idea what it means)  


It's been tough. There have been no plateaus, but there have been 1lb loss weeks, and i've changed almost nothing at all, and some weeks its 1lb, some weeks its 5. If i make myself eat more, it always seems that i lose a little more weight, but the hunger suppression is kicking in HARD for me and it's hard to eat now. Working on it.   


Life's better. I cant SEE a difference in myself, but everyone else does. I just feel some of it.   


Its been dirty keto the whole time. I have not counted calories a single time. Only carbs. Sometimes salt. Sometimes protein (the latter i never reach the goal of--but i cant help it rn)  


There's no 'goal weight' because the goal is life--FOR life. Eating any other way, simply isnt an option. It's getting easier to envision living this way, the longer i'm in it, and the more i force myself to learn.",keto,1

Well I had good intentions about ordering fish and veg of some kind but I was weak. My daughter kept saying, you don’t even need to lose weight (she’s too cute) so just have a treat meal. It’s very hard and awkward to explain the process of Ketosis to people who think it’s just a mad extreme diet. 

Anyway I caved. I then caved for 2 days after this. I had already started to see a difference in the first 10 short days so I’m pretty disappointed in myself. I started back on it yesterday and this time I’m cutting all sugar free fizzy drinks and sugar in my coffee.

I've been extremely accurate since April 1 regarding continual use of my fitness watch and carefully tracking intake to the best of my ability including supplements and even adding calories/nutrients from spices like paprika and garlic powder. I have an appointment tomorrow with a dietitian, and I'm hoping we can help craft me a long term keto intake plan that will keep me healthiest forever. I'm taking the intake info to them, to help craft my goals.

I thought I'd share with you my calorie and weight loss data since I restarted keto after 2 years off. I was already losing weight from a standard CICO diet, so I didn't really experience much if any of a woosh when I switched back to keto.

124 days of data

Avg consumed: 1706 calories

Avg est. TDEE (tracked with Garmin watch): 1942

Avg tracked deficit: 235 calories

Actual weight lost: 8.2 lbs

If we go by the flawed, but well-known, ""3500 calories = 1 lb of fat,"" the estimated loss would be 235*124 = 29,140 / 3500 = 8.3 lbs

I think my experience isn't going to translate to everyone because there's so many variables that are harder to account for when we're talking about an actual human instead of a computer modeling calculator. Metabolic issues and hormonal disorders, TEF, etc. that drastically alter how our individual bodies deal with ""100 calories"" of protein vs. fat or vs. carbs. And I think we still don't have good models of the kinds of adjustments we need to make to standard BMR/TDEE estimates. Myself, my BMR may fit within the standard model, but there's so much frustration out there people justifyably feel when we/doctors/online calculators say ""your BMR is X,"" when it's being shown over and over that people with metabolic conditions might have drastically lower BMRs than the ""average"" model used online. And add in the different ways our different guts actually handle the different kinds of food, and we get even more complication. A calorie might not be a calorie in all cases.

Even those that are paywalled have had really poor results after I paid the tax, so I'm putting out the request here, maybe someone else has succeeded where I failed. I need an app, a website, some kind of planner that has access to the following:

* A good number of recipes. Not just one, not a dozen dozen that I have to pay 3.95 for, but a variety of things so that I have options for myself and a very picky spouse, and a not-too-great grocery selection on base. I can make substitutions, but I need some variety beyond the 5 or 6 dishes I've learned by heart.

* Ingredients in a quickly accessible format. I can't fight around James' life story about her recent awakening and discoveries about keto, as much as I'm sure it's heartwarming, I need quick access to know which spices, and how many ounces of what kind of cheese or tomato I need.

* Accurate nutrition. I need to know how many servings a given recipe is actually for, as well as whether the net carbs listed are per serving, or for the whole dish. A number of the ones I found online failed to specify which it was at first, and upon digging in, I only discover that it's reasonable for the keto diet if I stick to eating something like a half cup of something for dinner.

I apologize if this comes off as a little bit sassy, but this has been a legitimate struggle I've been having. I know I can go and search recipes one by one, fight through Jessica's tale of her family history, and make substitutions and guesses, that's a lot of extra fight that just shouldn't be there. 

Thanks for taking the time to read this, deal with my venting, and explain my problem. If I'm lucky, maybe someone's even got a solution.",keto,1

41M/6'4/SW 238

I've been doing 18:6 IF for a year, doing first meal at 2pm, last meal at 8pm. I decided to start keto three weeks ago. After the second or third day on it my appetite dropped off enough for me to notice, to where now I don't feel hungry til usually 4 or so. I eat my eggs and spring mix and meat stick and I feel satisfied, then before I know it it's dinner time and I'm not even that hungry yet because I ate my first meal like an hour or so before. I will eat whatever protein I need to eat to hit my protein goal (130 per the calculator) but lots of times I'll feel very full and the calorie total will be like 1200-1300. I understand that that is a pretty crazy low number and I've read warnings about going too low, so I end up intentionally stuffing some evoo and cheese down until i hit 1600 calories.

Do I need to do that? Or should I just stop when I feel full off the protein?

Thanks for any guidance you have!",keto,1

owv57x,Does keto work less a second time?,"Hi everyone! I did keto for a few months in early 2020 and lost 25-ish pounds. I stopped doing keto completely during covid. I ate pretty much everything you shouldn’t. 

I later started going to the gym and focused on a high protein diet (lots of meat, eggs, fish, shakes, etc.) so a lot of that was keto complaint, but I would incorporate rice, veggies, fruit, protein pasta (soybean, chickpea), etc. I did this for three months while going to the gym 3-4 times a week, doing a mixture of strength training and cardio, and saw little to no result. This made me want to go back to keto since it was highly motivating to see quick results. 

Unfortunately, the second time around was much less successful. I didn’t lose anything (weight fluctuated up and down), but I did have a bit higher amount of net carbs. The first go around I stayed under 20 and the second time I was more like 20-35 while working out regularly. I’ve since gone off the rails in terms of diet and gave up on the gym.

I’m obviously very discouraged and wondering if keto is right for me. Personally, I don’t think I could follow this way of eating for the rest of my life. All my favorites foods are carbs and the alternatives don’t compare. For reference, I started at 235 F age 23 and am now 215-225 F age 24. I’m 5’6. I don’t have a very specific goal weight, but 150-175 would be awesome.

Is it normal to not lose as much the second go around? Do you think it’s because I was having more than 20 net carbs? How many net carbs do you have while working out regularly? It seems a little dangerous to eat too little while working out but I’d rather focus on diet than fitness if needed.

I’ve been steadily losing again and today I clocked in at 218.7 again! I’m more determined than ever to keep at this and not only maintain where I am now but to continue going lower. I struggled through the beginning of this year and stayed at about 240-250 until the end of May. But I worked really hard through June and July and here I am! 

I promise you guys will see the results you want if you can get into a routine with it! If eating is a comfort thing for you, it is imperative that you find other coping strategies. If you don’t then you’ll fall back on it when the going gets too rough. Also, keep it simple and plan plan plan. Make a meal plan for the week, then a shopping list from that, and get everything you need in one go. Eliminate the obstacles and make it easy for yourself and it gets so much easier to stick to.

owreig,Keto &amp; Covid,"Hi all.
So COVID has taken its toll on us all in different ways. I got it around mid December. I lost my sense of smell (what made me think I had it) and my sense of taste (it’s a really weird feeling). The lack of taste only lasted two days! Let me tell you it was strange. Basically I drowned my meat in salt and hot sauce. I could tasty salty. I could also taste if something was hot. It also was just wet. Didn’t taste the meat at all. Again, that lasted two days. 

So on and off the keto diet until April. Then things changed, for the worse. Still can’t smell mostly. Every once and a while I’ll smell but it quickly fades. Taste which was normal, now has turned on me for certain things: peanut butter, diet dew, diet cola, pork (not bacon), hamburger, mahi-mahi, tuna… probably more I am forgetting. 
They taste just “bad”. Can’t really describe it. I just don’t like it. My wife too (some of the foods, not all of them, and different ones).

Fast forward to today. More smells kinda come back, some hand soaps I pick up on. But other things kind of have the same negative smells tastes have. Shampoos. PVC glue. Pork. Other meats at times. Smell “covidy”.

Tastes are getting weirder. For example I’ve had a McDonald’s cheeseburger, not covidy. Had one from Culver’s, it was (but mostly masked from other flavors). Had keto taco bowls, gagged and couldn’t eat it. Taco Bell, minor hint of COVID. Had hamburgers on the grill the other day, delicious. Pulled pork smells covidy, but tastes ok. Tried smoked ribs and smoked hamburger, horrible. About the only thing I can stomach is chicken, my wife tastes it covidy. Had sandwiches on low carb bread, ham and roast beef is a no, turkey and pastrami is ok. My wife can eat peanut butter. Tonight I had shredded beef, green pepper, cheese (basically keto cheesesteak). It was gross to me. Garlic salt smells horrible.


Basically what I’m getting at has anyway one here had any issues like this? What have you done? It’s hard to stay on keto. Longest streak this year was a month straight. I don’t know if sugar is masking the horrible COVID taste or what. It just a bad scene. Thanks for reading my wall of text.😕",keto,1

owogrb,Could this be keto breath?,"Hi all! I have a question regarding my dad that I'm hoping someone might be able to help with. He has been strict keto for 3 or 4 years now. He's been pretty much every range of Keto from dirty keto to carnivore. He's been mostly carnivore for probably two years now and has just recently been adding in a few more carbs, primarily from vegetables. He also does IF.


The question is - in the last couple months he has been experiencing a pretty constant smell that resembles something similar to a cleaning chemical smell. It came on all of a sudden and has been pretty consistent for months now. He smells it everywhere, not just in his home, so it seems to be something related to him as opposed to his environment. He has been to several doctors, had an MRI, did not have Covid, and has exhausted pretty much every idea his doctors have. Today he went to a doctor (who happens to be keto) who thought it might be keto breath and suggested he eat a high carb meal to see if that makes it go away. Being familiar with keto, my dad and I had already thought about this possibility, but I've never heard of keto breath being so strong to the point of literally making him feel kind of sick/dizzy/woozy from the smell. Also, because keto is not new for him, I don't know why it would be coming on all of a sudden like this.

I know that many women reading this know exactly what this is like.   Only recently has it even become ok to actually acknowledge that it happens...   and now I'm at a stage in life where it isn't happening monthly anymore. I get a long break in between... 
* **I actually didn't know what Keto was. I** did see the word, but I didn't realise what it was. It's not really well known in Europe... 
* **It took Covid and having to do social distancing and working from  home...** to get more time to check things up online.... and then somehow I came across Keto and thought  ""I'll give it a try"".  I am SOOO grateful that I did!  
* **Having more money...**    Yes, that does help although I totally agree and support doing Keto on a budget. For me, it helped being an adult with the means to buy every little thing that can make the journey easier and more comfortable. This has certainly not always been the case in my life. Kudos to all young and broke people who do Keto on a shoestring.. It requires a little bit more willpower and ingenuity. 
* Having the maturity and experience to realise that this is a process that takes time. Stay organised and focussed for an extended period.  I was not good at this at all, as a younger person. 
* Covid and lockdowns, freeing up time to do the Keto research online and learn how the process work and tips and tricks from those who've already succeeded.

  I know it's most likely bloating.  I definitely stayed under carbs.  I dont think I had issues with calories,  but even if I did go slightly over it surely wouldn't have put nearly three pounds on me on two days right?

Eventually I run out of willpower and do a cheat meal which turns into a cheat day which turns into a cheat week, then suddenly I'm not dieting anymore.

I see a lot of people really concerned with clean versus dirty keto. If you are doing keto for weight loss, I'm here to tell you that the best keto diet is the one that you stick with. That means giving yourself some slack, but staying within the diet. Do you need to average 1500 calories a day to lose weight? Okay, but if that deficit causes you to relapse, maybe loosen it to 1600 or 1700 calories. If you have to binge every now and then, fine. Make sure to binge on something with no carbs and then when you wake up the next day you are still on your diet.

Give yourself some grace and do what feels sustainable. Just keep carbs out of it and in the long run you will be fine.

I'm very low energy person and this is pretty unusual for me - usually it only happens when I'm on an emotional high related to a great day or something.

owm2k9,Feeling hungover when I wake up.,"Background: I've had autoimmune symptoms since I was probably 8 y/o. Severe migratory arthritic pain, lethargy, GI problems, mental health issues etc.  


Fast Forward: I'm 25 and in the best shape of my life. I'm 5'9 150lbs \~12-14% body fat and have been on a keto diet for 8 months. (No cheat meals.) I work out every day twice a day(i do not skip a day). I can deadlift around 300lbs, benchpress around 225, and my squats are also around  280lbs. I don't have a problem running 5 miles in under 40 minutes and have an extremely active job. But, I still don't feel amazing. I'm having about a 1/3rd of the arthritic flare-ups that I used to and instead of being debilitating, they're just uncomfortable. So, I know I'm making progress. I don't have any of the mental health issues that I used to. But most mornings when I wake up, I literally feel drunk/hungover. I don't feel well-rested and it's a major struggle to get up out of bed. The last few mornings I've checked my ketones/blood-glucose and my glucose has been ranging from 97-107. Keep in mind I've never had blood sugar problems. Yesterday, I was walking downtown with my girlfriend and was out of breath from walking at a leisurely pace up I very mild hill. I've been waking up in the middle of the night stumbling around the house running into walls trying to get to the fridge for some food/water, and I barely remember it in the morning.  


My supplementation seems like it's on point, I'm being sure to get plenty of electrolytes in and am quickly running out of ideas. my macros at the moment sit at around 80% fat, 18% protein, and 2% net carbs.  


Also note, I have been doing 24 hour fasts at least once a week in efforts to get into higher levels of ketosis to combat my inflammation and other auto-immune-like symptoms.  


I have no idea what's going on and am so desperate as I am reaching out to reddit just for some ideas. Has anyone else experienced anything like this?

Usually, this is for the first \~ 3-4 weeks of Keto for me and then mysteriously it goes away (this is my second re-start of Keto). It does, however, last much longer than the keto flu symptoms.  I suspect another aspect of my problem is I combine Keto with intermittent fasting and probably don't eat very many calories each day (I say probably because I'm not tracking this time as much as I did the first time, now that I know what to eat). 

I've tried all the usual recommendations:  
\- exercise  
\- carbs before bed  
\- Magnesium Glycinate  
\- keeping up my electrolytes

This is probably the longest and deepest into ketosis I have ever been, and I'd prefer to stay on it for life because of how awesome it has been for me health-wise. However, due to probably a combination of ketosis, depression meds, and lingering covid side-effects, my appetite is destroyed. In fact, at least a few days a week I feel like I am force-feeding myself and it sucks. When I say force feed, I mean half of a low carb sandwich and a small handful of pistachios that took me an hour to finish. That's it for the whole day and I'll eat like that for days on end. The hunger never seems to catch up. 

I know this sounds like maybe a cool problem to have , but it kind of sucks. Imagine feeling like you are so full that you feel sick and then having to sit and force another meal down. That's kind of how I feel all the time. I push through it because I start to feel the other physical effects of hunger (dizziness, headache, etc.) And I know I need to get something into my system to keep me going. Eating is mechanical for me, a chore. I was the fat kid and fat friend my whole entire life and I never dreamed I would say this but, I really wish I didn't even have to eat at all. I wish I could just take a pill with the exact calories I need and be done with it. 

Now that I see this all written out, I realize it is cramping my style more than I admitted to myself, so I will definitely go see my doctor about it. I put it off because I'm still obese and trying to lose anyway. In the meantime, I have a few questions for those kind enough to read and reply:

Does anyone else struggle with this?

Is it okay to just not eat if I don't want to? Will my current fat stores + my multivitamin keep me healthy?

Any reccomendations for bland, inoffensive keto foods for when I need to force something down? Meal replacement shakes are a godsend but I'm up for other ideas.

owbom9,Staying on Keto without Plateauing. (?),"First time hitting 2 weeks without plateauing 🥳 I didn't even count the days, was really surprised how it went so easy without any carb temptation. Previously, it was SOOOO hard and I really struggled with staying on Keto as eating loads of carbs was something I grew up with and just holy as you could say. Now that I'm with family again (of which most have eating disorders/boulimia/are obese AF) the temptation is starting again but I'm resisting and coping up well with their disagreement. While I don't own a big kitchen, hate cooking or have anyone that motivates me and basically everything is against me keto dieting I'm still standing strong. 💪🏻 Here are my learning experiences on how I turned the tables:

- Avoid hunger like the pest. You'll ALWAYS overcompensate later on. Learn to eat in smaller portions and always keep keto snacks close to you. Drink more water, keto meals tends to be too savory and it helps (keep) feeling fuller. 
- Keep yourself busy with other things or goals, so you're not thinking about dieting and food the whole time.
- Do you know the psychological Pyramid of Maslow? Fix that. E.g. I had some financial struggles+(study) stress which kinda tempted me to eat emotionally. 
- Carb substitutions. Keto wraps, keto bread, keto crackers, keto pasta. Buy all of it. 
- Variety in food. Keto was so boring and I just HATE cooking in general. Prepping vegs and meats in 1 go made me have to only clean my greasy small-ass kitchen once a week. Spraying some olive oil on the surface of each meal really helps extending its shelf life. Boil eggs. Have a lot of things ready to eat on the go. Experiment a lot. (with spices!) 
- MAKE the damn Keto Fat bombs. I forever regret not being pushed to do this earlier, because this is a golden one(!). Dark chocolate (85%) only tempts me to eat more. Not a veggie/salad guy (at all) and it wouldn't matter how much veggies I did ate anyway, I still felt hungry only 1 hour afterwards. Now, only 2 fat bombs (which are actually really cheap to make) keeps me feeling full for like 5 hours easily. Bye sugar and chocolate craving! Glowing skin btw.

Also recently I've become a fraghead and found that sniffing (gourmand) fragrances keeps the craving away too haha.

- no IF or other restrictions, eat when hungry
- 23 net carbs daily 

JUNE/JULY RESULTS: 
- no alcohol -- loved this will keep it up 
- 1800 cal -- did it all but 4 days. Huge victory. 
- no IF or other restrictions, eat when hungry -- will continue this. I'm not ready for IF..
- 23 net carbs -- only 2 days above! Liked this bc I was able to get in vegetables and all nutrients. Know keto is technically 20, but feel 23 is right for me and still in ketosis. 

JUNE/JULY IMPACT: 
- weight/body: 10 lbs loss, size 14 to size 12. Size XL to M/L. 
- mood: fantastic!! No panic attacks by second half of experiment
- sleep: phenomenal. Only 1 insomnia night.
- mental/cognitive: amazing. Huge breakthroughs in started planning at work. 

AUGUST 2021 EXPERIMENT:
- Macros: 140 protein including collagen daily; carbs under 23 max with most days at 20. 
- Calories: under 1700
- Exercise: some type at least 3x per week. Complete half marathon.
- Mood: don't weigh at all during the month. No alcohol.

ow4b3y,Getting back into keto after successful attempt in 2020,"I first started keto last year. I was 210lbs (F/23yo), at my heaviest. One Saturday, I ate so much junk food; the following day, I felt sick when I thought of how much I ate, and I decided I would try keto. This was my second time trying keto, actually, but that first time only lasted a week. This second time, I managed to stay with it for a few months. I mostly counted my carbs, trying to keep it under 25-30g, and while I did sometimes go over that limit, I still watched what I ate. The first few days felt bad, but over time it was easier to stick with it (partly bc I wanted to avoid the drowsiness/sugar rush if I had too many carbs). I think lockdown helped because I had the motivation that I would look more fit the next time I saw ppl after lockdown (whenever that may be), plus I didn't buy any takeout food (to be extra cautious during the pandemic). I was excited to see my clothes getting looser and my face looking slimmer. When I saw a few friends, socially distanced, they noticed that I lost weight. I got down to 175lbs in \~5months. 

Since then, though, I haven't kept up with keto as well. With celebrations, I've given in to occasional cakes, chips, and even soft drinks (which I hadn't had in a year). I've been struggling to limit my carb (and sweets) intake, and my weight has fluctuated from 170-180lbs. I don't want to regain the weight I lost, so I want to try doing keto again since it's been my only successful weight loss method. I felt like I had better energy before, plus having too many carbs still makes me super drowsy (I can sleep for 3+ hours after a heavy meal). I really want to get back to a healthy weight of 145 lbs, or at the very least, get below 170lbs (which hasn't happened since 2017). It's so easy to use the motivation that I want to look better, but I found that that mindset made me beat myself up over not seeing results fast enough. Instead, I hope to have the mindset that I'm losing weight so that I can be healthier and stronger.

ow3axt,Keto: Is it all or nothing?,"Hi, for this month of august, I wanted to test out something estimating a Keto diet—mostly just trying to reduce my carb intake. The only issue is that I live with my parents and I don't do the grocery shopping, so it is really difficult to avoid carbs without starving myself. So far in my freezer all the foods I have to cook are at least 30 grams of carbs, and there are no meals I can make that mostly/completely eliminate carb intake. While I find it easy to avoid simple carbohydrates, complex carbohydrates seem to be a staple in most western cuisine. 

So my question is; is there a certain threshold that must be met in order to enter ketosis, or is reducing overall carb intake still contributing toward that metabolic state?

It’s not rocket science, but it’s a fact that has really been solidly driven home into my head recently. That, and having “faith in the system” (however you define a system). 

I’ve been keto since jan 2017, and general low carb since end dec 2016. My highest weight was 98.8kg, 96.8kg when I started keto. The lowest weight I clocked was ~61.5kg, almost a year ago. I have PCOS, and I don’t know if that’s responsible, but my body loses weight weirdly. I stalled HARD last year. I was still losing in terms of inches, getting visibly smaller, but my weight wasn’t moving. I still continued with the same eating and exercise habits. About four months ago, it actually suddenly went up by 2kg in the space of a week, even though my measurements were still trending downwards. Still continued, not adjusting anything from the POV of exercise consistency or food consumption. Today I weighed myself, and between yesterday and today my weight went down by 2.5kg - I’m now 61kg. I’m not recording that weight, because I only “count” it once it’s stable; but my point is - consistently and diligently sticking to good habits *will* pay off! Ofc check in with yourself and make sure you’re not eating too much or overestimating the amount you exercise, but if everything checks out - have faith in the system :) 

I’m posting this because I think it’s important to remember - cut yourself some slack when you’re getting frustrated at not making the progress you think you should, get back on the wagon even when you’ve “screwed up” - one derailment isn’t going to cause any real damage, be honest with yourself and make sure you’re not inadvertently sabotaging your progress, and enjoy all the non scale victories - big and small!",keto,1

ovyvbw,Is Keto good for weak and thin people ?,"Hello,

Let me tell you about myself.

My weight is 48 kg, height is 1,55 m. 

For all of my life, I have been weak and skinny with the most lowest stamina compared to my peers, I was always tired, I used to sleep 10-14 hours a day, I have acne for 7 years, always tired and sleepy with problem of focusing and memorizing. My face look tired and oily, I look like a walking corpse (yes , that bad).

I was drinking milk with 5 tablespoon of white sugar + bread for breakfast, meat soups/fish and wheat based food for dinner and lunch, my snacks between meals : sweet cakes and cookies, sweet chocolate milk, sweet yogort.



Since I started Keto, I give up my love for sugar, I felt like losing a part of myself, the part that used to make me happy...bla bla bla (this is getting dramatic, sorry).

My fatigue have decreased, my acne is getting better , my face color has been better, my  24/7 sleepy body is better by half. 

My concerns :

- Is keto bad for someone like me ?

- Is there any recommendations for me to improve my well-being?

Thank you!",keto,1

ovrwqx,Saying goodbye to keto...but on a positive note :),"Hi everyone :)

I just wanted to share my experience for those who want to eventually leave the keto lifestyle in search of something more balanced.

I did keto from May 2020 until end of July 2021. I lost roughly 16 kg and  I wanted to lose 5 more kgs and then leave Keto.  I am super grateful for keto. It changed everything. Besides the weight loss, I feel that I changed my relationship with food. I enjoy food in a more wholesome way and broke my addiction with sugar and sweets. I still enjoy a slice of cake with coffee, but I am OK with having that one portion and not wishing I could have 3. I drink more water and less sugary drinks. A sweet cocktail would be a treat and a dessert. I no longer see food as good or bad...more like, finding the combination that works for me and my body. I used to think I was totally lactose intolerant but I am surprised how during keto I could have creamy and cheesy dishes and not one single fart, LOL. My colitis also is 90% gone.

That being said, I kept stalling. I have to admit, I do not have the discipline to be constantly tracking carbs and macros...I just went lazy keto and mostly ate clean keto foods. I am changing jobs now and the past weeks have been very intense in the sense of finding a new direction in my career and also in my life.  Add to that the fact that our apartment has a tiny kitchen where we have zero counter space and no oven. So it was takeout (same old, same old - salads with chicken, tuna, or grilled chicken with veggies) or coming up with new ideas that I could do in our tiny space. I got tired and started to fall off the wagon for 1 or 2 days and then getting back up again.   


I also thought about the lack of information on Keto on the long-term. Now, I do not want to satanize this, nor judge anyone who has been doing it 10 years+ and is healthy as a horse. But I am someone who has high-blood pressure since a young age and has to take her of her kidneys a lot...so I am aware that if you don't drink enough water or aren't disciplined enough, you could harm yourbody by doing what I call ""irresponsible keto"".  On January 2021 I had blood tests done, and they came out great except for my blood sugar, oddly. I thought that they should have come out better but then again, during that time I had a week off keto.  
So I decided to leave keto for a while and consulted a nutriologist, here's what she said:

1) Number one and the reason I am sticking with her: She DID NOT JUDGE KETO, AT ALL. She congratulated me for my success in the diet, and stated I can ALWAYS go back to keto whenever I want. She said that it's evident that I reaped a lot of benefits with the diet and I could give it a try again in the future.

2) She has experience with patients on keto or who are leaving it. So she knows what the diet is about and had a look at my food diaries and meal times. She stated that most of her patients decided to leave keto because of the high uric acid and cholesterol levels (here I assume it's probably those people who ate very dirty keto and forgot about veggies). Oddly enough, in her experience, high sugar levels aren't that rare for keto dieters, and she said with a more balanced approach we can correct that. As long as your uric acid and cholesterol levels are in the normal range, it's fine, but when they aren't, it's toughter to get them back to normal.  


3) She considers that ketoers should pause the diet ideally for 6 months, every once in a while. It CAN put a strain on your body and nothing in excess is good.  Also, leaving keto should be done in a balanced way, otherwise you can harm your body if you are 0-carb HF today and tomorrow you start eating bread and pizza. You have to reintroduce carbs slowly, and not just ALL carbs.  


4) She suggested that we do first a transition diet. It basically has many normal ""clean"" keto foods, but with complex carbs and less fat. Example: chicken with quinoa, grilled salmon with avocado and veggies, greek yogurth with nuts, berries and an apple., zucchini and cheese quesadillas (with real corn tortillas).   


Anway, I just wanted to share this info for anyone who thinks that they would like to get off keto and try something else. There IS a life outside of keto but you have to make sure you do it right.  I try to live by my SO's motto: ""Everything in moderation, including moderation."" So I am eager to start this new phase in my life, and am SUPER grateful for keto and am SURE that I will revisit this wonderful diet in the future.

Keto is the best way for me to lose weight effectively, build discipline, and have a good overall metabolic health. However, it requires me to be in a healthy state of mind. Stress can easily make me cheat or trigger my binge eating disorder. Cheat meal turns into cheat day, into cheat weeks, and before I know it I undo all the progress I have done on Keto. Then in attempt to get back into ketosis, I try and fail multiple times.

So now I am trying to get back in ketosis and want to be more prepared in order to prevent myself from failing again. Obviously there will be mistakes here and there, but it doesn't have to be Keto or Cheat/Binge Eat.

 I've been strict: less than 19 net carbs, only low-glycemic foods, watching mineral levels etc.

about 30 minutes after eating it I started to get a headache — which soon turned into a migraine. then my joints started hurting and this wave of exhaustion both mentally and physically came over me. I had an awful night of sleep as the pounding head and dehydration prevented me from getting deep sleep. truthfully, I don't feel \*that\* much better today...

In the last years I've done some fasts too. My goal with keto/low carb is the metabolic health and not being a slave to hunger/eating.

I've started getting into the numbers recently, measuring for blood glucose and ketones, with the goal to help correlate objective numbers with how I feel (energy, hunger, sleep, exercise etc.). Being in ketosis corresponds with having energy and less hunger.

An exciting discovery I've had is I think I'm on the path to being metabolically flexible, easily going in and out of ketosis, my body quickly adapting to what I'm eating (or not eating). I'm not perfect, just like any other human, so sometimes I slip up and eat things I shouldn't.

Over the last few weeks I've been doing good on the diet, blood anywhere between 0.7 and 1.5 depending on time of day and when I've eaten. I was not perfect last night (more than just eating a bit too much) and as expected, my blood ketones dropped to 0.1 after my meal, before bed.

This morning, I woke up well rested with lots of energy. So as usual I check my morning blood ketones, and to my surprise my blood is at 1.3. Based on how I feel, it makes sense. I was energetic and ready to do my morning exercise.

Other times, 10lbs here, 15lbs there, I've always believe that, for me at least, it works. However, I've fallen off the wagon more times that I can count, call me poster child of yo-yo dieting. I'd make progress then take cheat day, then another, then months later, back to day 1. At the end of April I had a major relationship issue that put me into this ""get serious"" mode. Back on keto and I thing more importantly for me, hit the gym/workout...everyday. I started simple though, just a 30 min walk everyday around the block/park near my house. I know a lot of people have success without exercise, and I have too, but this time, I'm going to double up.

So started back on keto late April, doing daily walks and eventually that got boring. I guess I would call my mentality a ""dirty keto"" way cause I wanted this time to be sustainable. By no means am I advocating for any one to follow what I am doing, however, doing the daily exercise and 6 days keto dropped 35 lbs over a couple months.

Then...the stall, I sat at 35lbs down for the last month. 4 weeks w/o progress def a motivational killer. But I stuck with it for the most part, still no change. I felt better though, my clothes fit better, so I going to go off that to keep motivation up.

Thanks to you all, I started looking into stalls and what others have done to break it. I seen ""drink more water"", ""up your fat"", but the main thing that stuck out to me was being at too low of a calorie deficit. There was one user that posted an article about how too low of a deficit can slow metabolism down and it made sense to me. How you body might slow down to compensate for the low calorie intake.

Now keep in mind, I progressed from daily walks to daily workouts. Weights, Eliptical, running, etc. But what I was missing was tracking everything. I found that I was way under from not eating enough due to my relationship issues. I was working on a 1600+ deficit and my body compensated for that.

So now I started increasing calories (still keto of course) and BOOM, body is like ""I got fuel now, let's burn the reserves"".  Measurements are down a little, scale moved down, sweating a little more. I can feel the stall break.

I know that was a long ass story, but, it worked. Hopefully I can get to 45lbs down soon. Still pushing the daily workouts though and I think that helps mentally more that anything cause I don't want to waste the workout on garbage food. Hope this might help anyone else in a stall.",keto,1

I would still snack on nuts, pork rinds and veggies and still not be satisfied. However, if I then drink one protein drink (sugar-free, no maltit) OR eat 2-3 eggs in whatever form, the hunger craving disappears immediately and I automatically stop snacking after that.

Has anyone else experienced something similar? Do I have some sort of deficiency or something?

Now before I started I broke my back (L3 Vertebrae) and collapsed my L4 and L5 disc in DEC 2018  Layed up in bed until my Insurance approved of my surgery in July of 2020 (19 months of being bed bound and not being able to walk longer than 2 minutes without collapsing on the floor in pain) my depression went through the roof. I started eating to feel better (we can see where this is going huh) well I went for 45 minute surgery it lasted 9 hrs 😅 come to find out my spinal cord was Punctured by my Vertebrae  and that had to be repaired. Moving on after a 18 week recovery I finally got on the scale late Dec 2020. I was shocked I knew I gained weight but not that much I was staring at the numbers 387.4lbs I looked up in the mirror and was disgusted with myself all I saw was someone who wasnt me, so I decided to change my ways,gave up the food that made me feel good gave up the alcohol the surgery drinks and started keto, first week I hated it I wanted bread and sugar. 1 month later I got use to it and started to enjoy it I stepped on the scale and was at 372lbs I was shocked so I kept at it 20 lbs here 10 pounds there until today I have officially lost 100lbs and I won't stop until I reach my goal and when I do I'm not going  to go back to the way I use to eat.
I now consume at most 700 cals ( I know real low but I got use to it if I go over I start to feel queasy) I go to the gym 5 days a week for a minimum of a hour.  So 700 cals a day 35 carbs a day with getting my 70 g of protein is now my new normal  alot of my family think I'm starving myself  but I feel better now then I did at that my previous  weight and I've heard that eating so little is bad for you and I always say that may be true but being obese is worse. Anyways sorry if it's all jumbled  up and confusing  to follow  so anyways my starting weight was 387lbs and my current  weight is 285lbs I hope by the end of this year (2021) I'll be at 220lbs.

oumpk4,Carbonaut bread boots me out of ketosis.,"Was so excited to find a commercial bread that I could eat. 
Carbonaut.  2g net carbs per slice. (9 carb, 7 fiber) 

I found every time I ate a sandwich I would feel fine during the day and wake up the next morning puffy in my stomach fat and some face puffiness.  Retaining water, I presume.  Even though my gut itself felt ok.  But I will remain in ketosis.  (I track blood ketones for other health reasons) 

If I eat more than that, despite staying under 20g net carbs, I will be knocked out of ketosis.  If I stay under 20net carbs eating anything other than the carbonaut bread,  I am fine. 

One main ingredient is resistant potato starch. I know that when you bake resistant starch it will become not resistant, then cooling, it will become somewhat resistant again, but not as much.   I will inquire with the company also.  I suspect the nutritional information is flawed.  Perhaps they are basing this on raw ingredients before baking?  

 Tastes delicious and I am disappointed that I just don't think I can eat it.  I do know it affects me less than regular bread because I don't get the carb rush and impending fatigue I would get with a regular slice.  

 Will continue to buy it for the family though because I think it's better than regular bread for them.

What has your all experience been with carbonaut?",keto,1

ouls6z,Polyols in chewing gum and blood sugar,"When I check most chewing gum here in the UK it has around 60 to 70g carbs per 100g. One small tub of gum they typically sell in our supermarkets is about 100g for reference.

This article says Mentos is fine: [https://addtoketo.co.uk/best-chewing-gum-options-for-keto-in-the-uk/](https://addtoketo.co.uk/best-chewing-gum-options-for-keto-in-the-uk/)

Yet at the same time the article says to avoid malitol and maltodextrin, and both have a high GI.

But when I look at the Mentos ingredients it has a mix of almost every sweetener imaginable, including those two above. Does that mean that Mentos has negligible amounts of malitol and maltodextrin, and the 70g carbs per 100g (0g sugar / 67g polyols) is actually fine and won't spike blood sugar?

Official site for Mentos with ingredients half way down page says 0 sugars and 0 polyols: [https://www.mentos.co.uk/mentos-gum-white-peppermint-flavour-40-pieces#](https://www.mentos.co.uk/mentos-gum-white-peppermint-flavour-40-pieces#)

But even when I’m feeling good I have this strange breathing / twitchy anxiety, it’s like no matter how much of a deep breath I take it doesn’t seem to satisfy my lungs.

I thought it might be potassium as in all honesty I’m borderline carnivore because I struggle to get the veggies in…I’m not sure why! Must just not be much of a veggie muncher. If I up the salt and I’m low on potassium will it tip the scales big time and make the potassium deficiency worse?

Question is, if it’s potassium does low salt actually work? Because it doesn’t seem to with me! I have vowed to have an avocado every day but failed once again at that. I’ll try and have one with dinner!

oudnar,Effects so far,"So I’ve been on this diet about a week and a half (maybe 2 weeks?). I’m mainly using keto as a way to get my weight down fast in preparation for sports this fall. 

When I was doing heavy training last winter, I was constantly wondering why I was hungry. I would eat a large meal and be hungry less than an hour later. I chalked it up to my immense amount of mileage during roadwork and time in the gym, etc.. My weight during this time stayed the same (chubbyish- to fair. Never lean.) Looking at the work I was doing every day, I should have been ripped, but I couldn’t control my hunger.

Now that I have been off season for several months sitting around on my ass, I put on a ton of weight and still have this hunger problem. I suspect insulin resistance? Maybe some of you better informed folk could help me put the pieces together. I have gone ketogenic in preparation for going back to my gym this fall. 

I have lost around 13 lbs (most is probably water weight and GI tract weight). My skin is glowing. I haven’t seen my skin look like this in a decade and I’m not even trying. People in my circle of influence began complimenting my skin, and that’s how I actually noticed. My autoimmune condition is not as bad as usual. My bathroom regularity is fixed. I don’t feel like shit anymore man. I don’t feel the mental clarity some people talk about though. What does that feel like?

Cons:
Insanely decreased athletic performance for high intensity exercises.
Even running is affected (less so than more intense exercise)

My question concerns weight lifting while on OMAD &amp; Keto. I’ve started 20/4 intermittent fasting in April for a month then once I got adjusted I decided to do a One meal a day diet with keto in May.

Although the weight is coming off fast, I feel like the muscle is too. 
For those of you able to maintain or grow muscle how do you do this? 
I find it very hard to have a good gym session. I tend to stop lifting after 15 minutes due to fatigue (I usually try to lift before I break my fast at 5PM). 

I’m considering just keeping the OMAD/Keto lifestyle until I reach my goal of 165lbs/74kg then returning back to a more balanced diet including carbs and a good workout routine.
But I’m hoping there’s a way I can gain muscle while also doing keto and OMAD.

So now I’m just wondering what happens to these carbs when you’ve been following a relatively strict keto diet for a couple of months?  I guess my glycogen stores were depleted and the first thing the body will do is restock on glycogen before storing any fat, is that right ? 
So does it also mean that all glycogen I’ll stock will also be used in 1-2 days from now, and I’ll be basically be back on track ?

My swelling and trouble losing weight is coming from being pre diabetic.
When I started my keto journey in 2017 it was because I was diagnosed with PCOS wanted to lose the weight and have a baby.
I was on Metformin for a few years and it was easy to lose the weight once starting keto.
I had my child a year ago and I’m finding it difficult to restart.
I will restart and even one little slip up will cause me a 5 pound weight gain!!!
I had not been taking metformin anymore because my blood sugar levels weren’t checked after baby and just now discovered they are elevated again.
I no longer have the PCOS just the pre diabetes.

ou140e,Unintentional SV,"During the quarantine, I rediscovered my love for baking and homemade pasta and bread... and got up to 320 pounds - which was higher than my digital scale could register (after 308, it just pouts and threatens to file an OSHA complaint). I got a new analog scale that can read up to 400 pounds, so was able to verify that starting weight.

So, I got serious about keto, cut out all drinking, started very carefully tracking my macros, and dropped 5 pounds quickly (mostly water, I'm sure), but then... nothing. For a month. I was on a 40% calorie deficit, according to the calculator linked in the FAQ, and nothing was changing. I even started doing 2:5 intermittent fasting, and couldn't see any change on the scale.

Well, about that... like most, I weigh myself first thing in the morning. You know, before coffee, or even putting my glasses on. And I was completely misreading the scale, and what I thought were 5 pound divisions were actually 10. I'm at 303 as of today. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯",keto,1

I rigorously monitor the carbohydrate content of everything I eat, reading every label and recording every bite. Yet, I continue to struggle.

oty558,I think Keto is working,"So back at the beginning of covid, I weighed about 120 pounds. That was the first time in 15 years that I weighed less than 140 pounds. I had a very stressful 18 months which included a bonus pregnancy (I wasn't supposed to be able to have more children), moving very far away and then of course, covid.

I ended up gaining too much weight. Last August I was about 145 and it just kept piling on. In Jan of this year, I called my doctor because I weighed 160 pounds and now I needed help. He told me to try keto for weight loss. So I did keto for a few weeks and lost a couple pounds. I gave up because I was hungry, tired and cranky and I just couldn't see how it could work and be worth it. I went up to 170 pounds.

In May, I went for follow up blood tests and was told that if I don't change the way I eat, I'll be diabetic in 10 years. Seeing as how I have family members who are 300+ pounds and diagnosed with diabetes in their 50s, I'm betting my doc is correct.

I started keto again that day. I've had bad food only 3 times since then, and only very small servings. I have been doing well with it and have lost 15 pounds. I'm feeling better and my kids have told me I'm starting to look slimmer.

otxqpd,Keto Drain,"Yesterday was day three of keto after a year+ off.  The cravings aren’t too bad yet.  The low energy really killed me yesterday though, and I could tell my body wanted carbs.

I played disc golf at a very hilly course (a lot of steep &amp; tall hills to climb), and it was hot and humid as all hell.  Half of the course is in “open field” (I have quotes because there’s a lot of waist to chest high rough) in direct sunlight.

Hole 8 I was still doing ok, and chose to climb a VERY steep path (I’d guess &gt; 55 degree slope?  The kind where you dig your toes in and touch the ground to scramble up..) up a 20-30 ft hill.  Mistake.  Got to the top, and my legs burned.  After they stopped burning I noticed they felt noticeably weaker.  The energy I used to get up the hill was just gone.  My internal battery wasn’t recharging them.

Two holes later I was rubbing ice all over trying to cool down.  I could barely walk.  I’d also drank almost my entire 40 ounce hydrocell water bottle (with mio electrolyte added).  It did not help at all.

My buddy was drinking a Naturday, and I KNEW that if I drank one I’d feel recovered.  My body wanted those carbs so soo bad.  

After a particularly hard (at the time) hill climb on hole 14 (~35 degree slope for ~250 feet) I finally called it.  I quit on hole 15.  It took me 10-15 minutes of rest to not feel woozy anymore.   Really sucked.  

I grabbed a meat stick and more water on the way home.  Wanted a shitty gas station breakfast Sammy so bad.  Only thing that made that easy to resist was that I knew I had an awesome dinner waiting for me.  Finished the night with two bacon double stacks on a keto hamburger bun from Walmart.  

I played that course two weeks ago with zero issue.  I’ve never noticed keto drain my energy that much before.  It was nuts.  I’m not worried about cheating or anything.  I was surprised that my body was craving so hard with such clear signals.

otv7r4,I never realized how much money I was spending on junk food,"So like many people I had emotional eating issues, mainly when I was bored/feeling low and nothing would even temporarily boost my mood except food. I tried to do the “out of sight, out of mind” approach and just stop buying the junk food so it wasn’t sitting around the house, then I’d find myself going to the store nearly every day to buy a single day’s worth of junk food (technically it wasn’t meant to be a single day, I just ate it all in one day). 

Finally decided to try keto because I hoped it would help with my epilepsy. I saw a huge improvement, my lingering nighttime seizures were gone and my daytime fatigue drastically improved. This gave me one hell of an incentive to stay keto. A bad day was going 10g over my 20g limit. Often I could compensate for these over indulgences by going to the gym and doing an hour of cardio after the mistake (also for some reason keto seemed to help with my exercise-induced asthma).

So without my daily trips to the store to buy junk food, my grocery expenditures started to drop even though I was buying the pricier stuff like grass-fed beef and butter and coconut MCT oil. I’d always heard keto was expensive, but it turns out eating like crap is also expensive. Another benefit was that during COVID there were a lot of shortages, but no one tried hoarding the fresh vegetables or cheese so I wasn’t really affected, aside from not finding my favorite salami and sometimes having to make chicken instead of beef or vis-versa.

otresi,Egg yolks for electrolytes?,"I mean I know not all eggs have equally high mineral density, especially nowadays with low quality mineral and nutrient deficient foods sources being the majority of what most people have access too. But consider the following, I just bought some electrolyte product off amazon as I definitely feel dizzy and tired if I don't supplement electrolytes in some form. I run 3 days a week and strength training one day a week, so not insane amount of activity, but enough that I need to supplement electrolytes or I feel like crap. (I'm not going to provide a link to the electrolyte product because I don't know if that's against the rules or might be seen as me trying to market stuff, which I'm not). The mineral contents of the electrolyte product are as follows:

per 1/2 tsp in 32 ounce of water mixed, potassium: 150 mg, magnesium: 45 mg, zinc: 3 mg ,chloride: 375 mg ,sodium: 125 mg

Now, according to Wikipedia (not a perfect source for info I know but we are talking egg yolk mineral content here), by just eating one egg yolk you can estimate a mineral content around the following (link [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yolk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yolk)):

per one egg yolk, Calcium 129 mg, Iron 2.73 mg, Magnesium 5 mg, Phosphorus 390 mg, Potassium 109 mg, Zinc 2.30 mg

...along with all the other goodies that comes with egg yolks. And if you really want all the protein of the white too and aren't worried about the biotin depleting aspects of the white, you got that too if you want. 

What I'm asking here, is could I just use raw egg yolks with some sea salt daily to cover all my electrolyte needs? What am I really missing here if I go with mainly egg yolks to cover electrolytes? Magnesium? I take a multi vitamin but I really don't wanna be dependent on a bunch of vitamin capsules I need to take a day. Also i want the cholesterol fat amino acids and other benefits from the egg yolks anyway. My morning routine for the past week or so before I run is to take one to two yolks (no whites) and mix with sea salt, pepper, a little vinegar, a little water, and drink it down. It's tasty.

otq7cs,Anyone else have cloudy urine at random on keto?,"Hello all. 

Ive been doing keto since last march and ive lost approximately 150 to 160 lbs so far. I recently broke through a stall I had been having by starting to weigh and track my food to ensure I'm eating at a deficit.

Im super happy about all the weight ive lost but Ive had weird pain symptoms pop up since the begining of this year. Essentially ive got pain all over my body ( arms, legs, back, chest, neck) Ive been to the doctor more times than I can count this year and they still haven't figured it out yet.

 I have been keeping up with the electrolyte requirements as well. Im deficient in vitamin D as well as iron and im supplementing both.

Another weird thing ive noticed is that occasionally ( maybe a few times a week ) my urine will be cloudy. (Think of what the cheap top ramen soup looks like.) Ive told my doctor about it and hes taken urine samples multiple times and said that other than a small amount of protein in the urine, its normal. I usually keep up with enough water with maybe some days taking in about 48oz. 

My doctor attributed the protein in the urine due to me eating a lot of protein but not using it to build muscle. Ive pretty much only been walking daily for exercise. Though of course, Dr. Google tells me cloudy urine is very very bad. 

My question is, does anyone else get occasional cloudy urine while on keto? I didn't notice this at all last year and I had been doing dirty keto up until this year where ive become more strict at adhering to my macros (30g or less net carbs per day and usually 100 to 150g of protein, 100g fat and under.

otnwph,Why i haven't gone Keto - again.,"Hi all,  
I am 32 year old male from Australia who has struggled with my health my whole life. Particular auto-immune responses to food (i had schleraderma as a child, have a compromised immune system as a CF carrier, had asthma also as a child). So i have sensitivity to pasta, beer, etc.  
I went on a health journey about 7 years ago which culminated in me going Keto (before Keto was popular).  
I lost some weight (but that last 10 kilo's was persistent and i couldn't lose) but i did love the clarity in my thinking. I also had great recovery from workouts as i was doing Crossfit at the time.  
However, i had explosive IBS (I was doing Bulletproof coffee at the time).  
It got so bad i almost couldn't eat or drink \*anything\* without the entire contents of my stomach becoming water within a minute.  
My diet consisted of Bulletproof coffee for breakfast, an omelette for lunch and steak with some green veggies for dinner.   
Eventually, i had so much mental fatigue from the IBS and such strong cravings for veggies and  carbs, and i also grew sick of omelettes and meat, i eventually went vegetarian, eating lots of rice, vegetables and sourdough bread and felt so much better! My IBS cleared up in a matter of weeks, my energy levels went through the roof and i lost the remaining weight.  


Needless to say, in the remaining years, i have stuck to vegetarianism and was quite anti-Keto for a long time. I have recently read Gary Taubes book the Case for Keto to remain open minded and find his arguments somewhat convincing, although it conflicts with my own experience.  


In the last few months i have begun eating meat again and now eat a normal diet, not restricting any food group, but try and keep things as organic and natural as possible.  


My weight has crept up over the last few years though, and i am now approaching my heaviest weight in a long time. I no longer work out, and am having the autoimmune responses from grains and have lot's of inflammation in my joints. My Doctor has started an investigation in to systemic inflammation and in to a as yet undiagnosed autoimmune condition: I have joint and muscle pain all over.... sore knee's, ankles, back, shoulders.... If you looked at me you wouldn't think anything is wrong. I have a bit of a belly but other than that i am an athletic guy but underneath the surface lot's of inflammation.  


So now, i am wondering what to do. I am considering giving Keto a go again, with the benefit of hindsight and more education, but the IBS issues last time gave me PTSD! So i worry about that. I also love Sourdough bread and am a passionate home baker. So i have an emotional attachment to sourdough.   


But, at the end of the day, i can't keep living with so much inflammation. So i have to figure out how to fix it.  


Sorry for the essay, i just want to see if anyone can offer me any help.

otm8is,did the jack kruse leptin reset,"I'm trying to lose weight as I gained quite a lot the last year due to poor dietary habits.  Going from having a personal trainer to 0 exercise last year didn't help either.  Now trying to get in good shape again.

I did the Jack Kruse Leptin Reset and have had great results.  For me, it lasted 2 weeks.   I dropped 8 pounds (mostly water weight of course) and an inch off my belt.  

First 48 hours was a bit rough.  Not terrible but not good.  I had many of the keto flu symptoms despite taking a lot of salt + electrolytes, and generally felt hungry.  But days 3-14 were pretty good -- very few symptoms besides extreme thirst and that is starting to get back to normal slowly.   By day 10, my hunger throughout the day was basically none existent-- I'd get the occasional minor hunger pain but that was it.    I didn't count calories.

A typical day would be:   

* breakfast as soon as I woke up (within 30 min of waking, this is key): bacon and canned oysters\*. 50-60 grams of protein worth
* lunch:  spinach salad with salmon 
* dinner:  steamed vegetables (broccoli, Brussel sprouts etc) with steak

Drinks: only ice water, coffee (black), and herbal tea.  

 I didn't have much variety: sometimes would have eggs for one meal, have some other kind of seafood etc.  It was pretty seafood heavy (this is what Jack Kruse calls the Epi-Paleo version).  

  \* Oysters were always either fresh and raw if at a restaurant or trader joe's crown prince olive oil canned oysters -- these are amazing!

Now I just started phase 2 which is a bit similar but with much more flexibility and you add HITT exercise into it (you should avoid almost all exercise besides a bit of walking in phase 1 for various reasons).  So far so good.  Anyhow, just wanted to share in case anyone else was looking into some of Jack Kruse's methods.",keto,1

otlqe9,One Day Fat Fast,"I’ve been planning on doing a 2-3 day fat fast to follow whichever day I inevitably binge this coming week, kind of like a reset. I hadn’t set out to do a fat fast today but I randomly decided to, partly because I’ve been experiencing a plateau. I should mention this was my first time trying it. Fuck. Do I feel sick as hell. Luckily I’m fasting now and getting ready to make a cup of tea, but I really hurt my stomach with all of the cream cheese and stevia. I could get more into it but that probably belongs in r[BingeEatingDisorder] 
All this is really just to ask: did I waste this day of eating? All of the information I can find on fat fasts say they are typically 2-5 days. More often 3. I am absolutely not fat fasting tomorrow. Did I fuck up, or will I still reap the benefits? i.e. an easy way to reach ketosis + encourage fat loss?

1,155 kcal
29g carbs
17g net carbs
26g protein
101.5g fat

I was doing keto on and off, but had a hard time staying motivated. About a year ago I started lifting weights (Starting Strength for a few months, 5/3/1 since then), and for whatever reason, that really helped me stick with the diet.

I'm not sure how much credit to give ""keto"" specifically. I think I probably would have had just as much success with any similarly high protein/low calorie diet, although I much prefer restricting carbs to restricting fat. TBH I don't know how often I've actually been in ketosis, I generally get something like 20-50g of carbs per day but I don't keep close track. And I have a ""cheat day"" every other Saturday. But the general structure of ""low carb, high protein"" has been really successful for me.

I'm still planning to stick with some form of keto diet for the foreseeable future. My eventual goal is to reach 10%BF, ~160-165lbs, so hopefully there's another ""Success Story"" post in my future some time in the next few years.",keto,1

I'm hoping to take the weekend off Keto (to celebrate, we're traveling to a hotel/brewery chain we love specifically for their great beers), then it's back on keto to see if I can lose another 5 for a wedding in Sept, then another ten for a wedding in early Nov.  

I lost 16 pounds last year on Keto before the shutdown happened and I decided if rounding out meals with things like rice or potatoes meant fewer trips to the store, it was worth it.  Plus, not-dieting felt like the only solace left.  The difference in options between just over a year ago and now is AMAZING!  Keto bread last year was hard-to-find and overpriced  - I only tried it because I got walloped with a flu and toast is the thing my body craves when sick.  Now you can get Keto bread from Kroger.  And it's good!  It's 4 net carbs but for one nice piece of toast, it's totally worth it!  I got Keto cereal from Wal-Mart the other day (great for when I forget to eat past the point of being able to cook).  Keto ice cream is also a game-changer.  My partner loves ice cream so the fact I can sometimes join in instead of always just watching like a Dickensian orphan makes this much more sustainable, long-term.  

I know a lot of y'all have worked harder, longer, been more diligent...  But one of my biggest problems is I actively dislike thinking about food.  I work two jobs and the time and effort to even buy the right groceries feels like one chore too many.  Sometimes I have to be reminded to eat.  So the fact I'm cooking more, eating \*right,\* and building good habits is huge for me.

The first day was surprisingly easy. But yesterday, and moreso today, I am CRANKY. Does anyone know if Diet Coke and Splenda cause withdrawal? I'm a stay-at-home dad of two toddlers, so keeping my mood positive is incredibly important to how the day goes. If there are withdrawals, how long do they last? Should I have tapered?

Thanks so much. Love this sub.",keto,1

I have been on strict keto for 75 days as of today and officially down 40 lbs. It feels great to be able to fit in my clothes again and feel comfortable in my own skin. The first photo of me was a year ago today. The second was this past weekend. 

I have tried losing weight using keto again and again for years. I have always had success right away but after I see some result I start allowing myself cheats. This time was different. I have logged every single thing I have eaten in the past 75 days. I have stayed under 20g of carbs everyday for 75 days. I had one cheat day when I drank some beer but for the most part no cheats. 

i know these photos don't really look that much different. TBH, I don't have a ton of photos of me at 300 lbs.

With full intent on keeping it crisp and to the point, here's a timeline of events. 

Apr 28 - Went cold turkey on Spirits/Beer/Wine. Followed a diet high in carbs, protein and fat. Normal diet?!? 

May 10 - Started working out with personal trainer. Super intense workouts - 3 days a week, 1 hr each day - Strength training, Crossfit, Resistance training. Followed a diet high in carbs, protein and fat. 

May 24 - Super intense workouts 3 days a week, 1 hr each day and started diet prescribed by trainer - Following carbs included each day - 4 tablespoons of Muesli including raisins , 4 oz of 2% milk, 1 whole wheat roti). Followed diet to the T. Still no alcohol. 

Jun 01 - Increased super intense workouts to 5 days a week, 1 hr each day. Same workout plan and same diet. 

July 24 - 2 months of dieting (to the T) and workout complete. Great progress observed in body measurements and weight. Time for a treat. PLANNED to join friends on pub crawl - leading to 5 sugar less cocktails in one night. 

July 24 - Cut breakfast Muesli in half, 2 oz of 2% milk, no Roti. Consumed exactly 5 sugarless cocktails in 1 night. 

July 25 - Cut breakfast Muesli in half, 2 oz of 2% milk, no Roti. Feeling Hungover. Assumed it was a typical hangover after drinking. 

July 26 - Ate regular amount of Muesli and milk, still no Roti. Still feeling hungover. Researched and found hangover can sometimes go up to 72 hours. Mild nausea, light headed and giddy. 

July 27 - Feeling the sickest ever - nausea and threw up once - 1 instance of diarrhea - dizziness (couple times felt like pass out during workout, but didn't) - feeling confused and lack of focus at work - sugar craving (ate at least one whole candy bar of dark chocolate the previous day). 

Does this sound like the keto flu?!? How do I get out of this?!? Please help!

Quick background: I've done keto in the past, but it has been a few years. I decided I need to lose a few lbs and went back on the keto diet. I'm the lazy keto type, so I just mainly avoid carbs and exercise.  My typical exercise routine is to lift weights 3 days a week, and ride my bike for an hour about 5-6 days a week.   


During the weekdays, lunch is usually 5 eggs and some cheese maybe 3 slices of bacon. Dinner is a pork loin, a large bowl of salad, walnuts, and walnut oil. Sometimes I cook up some mushrooms too. My one bad habit, is I'll randomly go ham on ice cream from Enlightened Keto series. Although after eating it, it doesn't seem to throw me out of the ""purple"".  


Typically I wake up, I'm not purple. I have black coffee for breakfast, then check again. Not purple. I lift my weights, ride my bike, check again, not purple. It usually isn't until after lunch I go purple, and this stays the course through the night until I wake up again. My last check is usually right before I get into bed.

I also workout 3-4 times a week, hiit and workouts with kettlebells. The results are great and I couldn’t be happier with how I look ( much leaner) and feel ( super energetic, dynamic). 

Sunday I played tennis with a friend for 1h30 without blinking an eye. Feeling great. 
But at the end of the day I felt overly tired, and my tongue felt dry all the time. 


My hypothesis is that since my tennis session was longer than my average workout, I lost more water (sweat) than usually, and with water, I lost a lot of electrolytes. Which explains the tiredness feeling, and why I can’t seem to get rid of that dry tongue even by drinking a lot of water. 

Since then (Sunday afternoon) I’ve been drinking stock, added more salt and potassium than I usually add in my food. I’m not tired anymore, but my tongue still feels dry somehow.

Could I already be keto-adapted perhaps (since I hear that the test strips only detect excess ketones that the body doesn't need)? Or is there something else that could be going on here?

Another thing is that this isn't the first time I have done keto. For about 6 months from 2019-2020 I was doing semi-strict keto (always under 50 grams, usually under 30 grams). Is it possible that my body got keto-adapted then and I am getting adapted quicker now due to that?

I have had success on keto in the past, but struggle with it at times and the constant fluctuation between going on keto and off is difficult. 

First question - Is going on and off keto bad? Does it make it harder to lose weight? In both scenarios in at a calorie deficit

Secondly and more importantly, if I decide to stop keto but keep carbs at like 50-75g of carbs/daily, which means I'm not exactly in Ketosis, would I still lose body fat? Or, would the body need to burn through the glycogen stores/water weight constantly?

I follow a diet not all that dissimilar to that prescribed to people with severe epilepsy, except my diet is not quite as restrictive allowing me to enjoy a wider range of foods, but I still get exactly the same benefits, I believe due to the regular fasting that I undertake.

At most I follow a 16:8 fasting ratio, but frequently stick to OMAD, only eating very low carb foods. What is of utmost importance however is the complete avoidance of any possible sources of gluten proteins as my neurologist believes they are the root of the current epidemic of neurological and psychiatric conditions, and the reason I hallucinate, go manic and suffer severe cognitive impairment (https://www.glutenmad.com). He tells me quantities smaller than that needed to trigger a reaction in people with celiac disease can still make me very unwell.

I can’t begin to describe how life-changing a very low carb, gluten free, whole food fasting diet has been. I had been unemployable for years, frequently committed to psychiatric hospital and was unable to function in society. Today I’m in a top city job, lost 80lb (all in my first year), and I’m told by my psychologist my IQ has risen 30 points. I’ve also reversed a whole load of other health problems. Above all though is my mental health is in great shape and I’ve been med free for 5 years.

The paper I linked above gives a glimpse into the power of the right diet. I believe it’s a combination of three things at work: the removal of immune triggering foods such as gluten, which activate the anti neuronal antibodies that mess with the brain (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5629440/ ); the drastic changes to the body’s chemistry - the drop in inflammation, the up-regulation of hormones, the control of blood glucose, repairing the microbiome etc. (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30359969/); and the powerful effect that ketones as a fuel in the brain have in actively protecting from and then healing the damage (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7699472/).

Humans evolved over hundreds of thousands of years eating a low carb diet with regular periods of fasting. It’s clear that some of us haven’t yet adapted to the modern diet and this ancient way of eating is necessary for prolonged physical and mental health. At the root of it all are the gluten containing grains (and possibly other trigger foods), and are likely the reason 6% of people suffer migraine, dizziness, brain fog and depression (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32857796/) and some go on to develop psychotic illness (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4517012/).

The wrong diet might be at the root of the epidemic of severe mental illness. The right diet, it seems, might be the cure.",keto,1

That being said I am beyond frustrated today.  I was traveling and had plenty of food packed, but left my drink at home.  So, I went through a Fast Food restaurant and ordered an unsweetened tea. They were out so I ordered a Diet Coke.  No biggie.  When I drank the Diet Coke it tasted like they had messed up the carbonation-to-diet soda mix or something bc it tasted a little sweet to me.  I drank about half (of a 44oz drink) and couldn’t drink any more.  When I got home I put my drink on the counter and told my daughter she could have it if she wanted it (she’s 18).  My daughter grabbed a big swig and said, “Whoa, mom, when did you start drinking regular Coke?  You know that’s not Keto, right?”  So, there is my answer to the taste of the soda.

os4fdh,I feel amazing on Keto as long as I consume caffeine,"I just copy &amp; paste what I posted on a community thread two weeks ago, because I received only one reply (electrolytes, which aren't the issue), and I really need some insight here.

(( I feel amazing on Keto as long as I consume caffeine. Without caffeine, I'm an empty shell of myself, without motivation to do anything, poor mood and my brain can't avoid linking my thoughts to food, like it would solve anything. Does it mean that Keto is not meant for me? I'd like to avoid carbs because I'm insulin resistant. I never got fat on carbs, because the carbs I mean are actually vegetables, but I don't miss the days when I was always bloated. My goal, once I have the money to do so, is to switch to carnivore, but is there a hope for me in low carb diets without the poison that is caffeine?

I bought coconut oil/butter again to see if it has the same effect as coffee, but I will blend it with tea.

I'm on Keto for more than 8 months. In December, I stopped drinking coffee and everything went downhill since then. There are days when a switch flips and I feel motivation, but they are rare. Recently I started drinking coffee again, but it reminded me why I stopped doing so in the first place: hypoglycemia. Stopped drinking again, back to being an empty shell. One week and a half without single gram of caffeine, and on the two days I felt good I had coconut meat, so I think it could help.

A year ago I lost a lot of weight eating banana + peanut butter sandwich, because despite being hungry all day long (extreme deficit), I had the motivation to keep the deficit and to do one hour of heavy cardio per day. However, my mood was very unstable and, of course, I was always hungry.

I tried upping fat, upping protein, flirting with the carnivore diet, but nothing beats the artificial energy boost from caffeine. )) Repost ends here.

Besides caffeine, another thing that works is eating, like, an ungodly amount of protein, like a whole rotisserie chicken on eventual weekends, because protein turns into glucose, and I'm sure of that. It may not give me the energy or good mood at the same time, but it's either one or the other. 

Two days ago I decided to test if I'm compatible with Paleo or low carb and ate a huge amount of cabbage, because I can't stop craving that thing whenever it is at home. Felt more or less fine, but could be better. However, the next day I went to the market and was craving bread, papaya among other sugary stuff. Yesterday I went with way less carbs for my lunch, but then I started craving cucumbers, the only veggies available at the time. Had to put an end to them, and felt miserable for the end of the day. Today I thought, bananas might not be that bad after all, since I lost a lot of weight eating them (I lost weight eating carbs on a deficit plus cardio, and joined Keto after achieving my goal) but a bit after breakfast I was struck with extreme anxiety and depression, like I had to do anything at that time as soon as possible, what is the point of life etc. That anxiety went away eventually, I went to the gym and from that point on, it's back to Keto, but experiencing Keto flu one more time. After eating the banana and hitting the market post gym, surprisingly, I was not craving more sugary fruits or things of the sort. Bought three avocados.

The reason I don't leave Keto is I simply can't sleep if I eat a lot of carbs close to bed or throughout the day overall. On Keto, I can fall asleep in five minutes, go to the bathroom some times during the course of the night (I grew accustomed to it) but back to sleep. No insomnia. But sleep quality aside, I can resume my actual life as wondering if the next meal will finally solve my fatigue and lack of motivation. 

What to do here? Am I still suffering from caffeine withdrawal? I tried decaf, but it makes more tired. Chamomile and mind teas have filled the role with some efficiency.

Please, abstain from posting the word ""electrolytes"", because I'm stuck on this for a long while and I meddled a lot with them already. 

I just want to experience the benefits of Keto (mental clarity, endless energy) like I did months ago, but without the poison that is caffeine. It makes me anxious and sometimes induces hypoglycemia (insulin resistant by the way). Is it possible?",keto,1

I'm new here so hopefully the formatting and rules have been followed appropriately. I've had a negative relationship with food my whole life have lost repeatedly 100+ over and over again. I'm at a point now in my life at my age that I need to make this stick permanently as a LIFESTYLE.

Background: I'm currently doing a OMAD with my feed time at lunch and the app I've downloaded advises I need around 1800kcal daily with the following breakout 18g C/126g P, 136g F. I'm pretty sedentary right now and I'm being very restrictive on my carb intake somedays it's just the lettice wrap from my burger. 

My typical meals revolve around eggs, spinach, hamburger patties(80/20), chicken and turkey. 

As I'm consuming healthier foods I'm finding it's very difficult to get all of my kcals and percentages in one sitting its too much and makes me sick. I'm alternating between some days with kcals less than 1000(while still keeping my carb intake extreme low) and others when I'm around 1200-1300. 

I have a number of questions:  If I don't take in my required macros and or kcals is this detrimental to my weight loss? I understand fat is for satiety and the real emphasis is on carb intake and protein(I get plenty of this daily). Also, on some days to try to get my calories in I've been having a red Robin burger(no buns, no fries, no condiments, nothing with sugars, lettuce wrap) to try to up my protein, fat intake. Is this detrimental? 

I don't care anymore what I have to do to get my goal of 225. I will suffer whatever I need to do to make this happen, sweat, bleed whatever. I'm feeling much better I will have to say and have noticed my stomach go down and more increased energy and clarity of thought but haven't seen much progress in last two weeks. I was 329 and now 326 so looking to make adjustments where needed to accelerate. I don't feel like I should be lifting yet(outside of doing body weight exercises) only cardio. Probably a combination of HIIT and endurance training.

Background:

i do keto for some months now but i do fall of the wagon often. Lets say i do strict keto for 3 weeks and then do a cheat day which in turn often led to an cheat week.


As i recently found out these cool keto benefits like more energy, better mood etc. do come with training the body with consistent keto for 8-12 weeks.


I've come to the conclusion that i don't want to stick strictly to keto all the time. I want to get an chocolate or an bottle of sweet port wine. 




Now the real question:
Do i need to be strict in keto all the time to get all the good long term benefits or can i ocassionally go overboard with keto (lets say 1 day every 3 weeks) and just hop on the waggon again?


Aditionall thoughts:
Unfortunately I am both an perfectionist and weak to the point of self manipulation. I want to get all out of keto. But from time to time there is this evil thing in my thoughts that question why i even do keto and that it's not even needed as i've already reached my main goal weight. Then i break keto and proceed eating carbs cause I think everything is lost so it doesn't matter. It was already an huge help to know that the long term benefits are not lost from one mistake.

7 weeks I don’t know how much I’ve lost, but this is the second belt I had to buy and there are visible face and body gains. I started at bf30% and I estimate I’m slightly below 25 today. 

I also exercise 3-4 times a week, doing HIIT. 

Yesterday I played tennis with a friend and omg. I used to need 2 breaks to rest during one went through one hour of playing. I used to slow down while I was grabbing the balls to cach my breath. 

yesterday I blazed through one hour and a half of playing with nothing more than sweat and increased breathing. My friend who is much less fat was actually much more in need of pauses than I was. 

So I thought It would be nice to share that the gains are not only in looks and such a huge difference in performance and how I felt makes me want to experience what it is to actually be fit and do sports.",keto,1

I don't really have many symptoms except anxiety, but I feel like the anxiety is triggered by the fear I feel when I see low blood sugar numbers, not the other way around. Not sure. I have never been diagnosed as diabetic/prediabetic and prior to keto my fasting blood sugar was usually in the 80s or 90s. 

I really don't want to go back to eating carbs as I was addicted to them and now for the first time I actually feel stable. Diabetes also runs in my family and even though I'm only 25 I really want to get a jump on preventing it. It's scaring me so much, though, to see those low numbers. So far I've eaten some peanut butter in the middle of the night to try and stabilize, but it doesn't last more than a couple of hours as I sleep. What can I do?

I keep lurking around this subreddit for motivation, recipe ideas, success stories, but recently... I've been catching myself looking for posts about those who veered off the path temporarily and came back stronger or 'lived to tell the tale' to try to justify I will be okay if I reward myself, but knowing myself it's a slippery slope and I don't want to end up going into an all out bender \[as past experiences have proven\]! Help! 

I'm still at least 10-15 lbs from where I would want to be, but I lost most of the Pandemic Weight at least. Granted, from the 15 lbs I lost, half of it is probably water weight so it doesn't feel like I really made ***that much*** progress. =/ This is my 3rd round doing keto and I've been doing great from about 1.5 months, but it's been more of a lazy/dirty-ish keto ranging between 20-40 net carbs and sprinkling in OMAD or IF and exercise starting last week. 

I have 2 birthday dinners, a concert and a wedding coming up. 1 of the Birthday dinners is at my **all time favorite restaurant** which is super carb heavy and the 2nd is at a brand new restaurant I've been dying to try. Now, theoretically I could stay keto for both since they also have tons of meat dishes, but they're fancy spots so I think what bothers me is that I'll have to be spending $100-$150 and not be able to enjoy any of the awesome appetizers (my favorite part of the meal) that everyone else will be eating and which I will be paying for. 

Same goes for the Wedding. I'll be dropping a substantial wedding present, which feels like I'm paying for my table and seat and I know the food will be phenomenal and diverse and I want to try ALL of it to ***get my money's worth!*** \[This is the underlying issue - but also I just LOVE food and carbs\] It will be my first wedding I'm attending since Covid started and I feel like I haven't done anything fun this summer and it's almost over and I want to enjoy myself and Keto kind of put a damper on my Social Life a bit... 

I also have a concert I will be attending and it's also my first one since Covid. The alcohol part will be easy as I love vodka and soda but the beer and drunken Pizza after is where I'm scared I'll slip... especially in an intoxicated state! But I want it so bad! I'm having major anxiety about what I should do! 

I want to let go and I'm rationalizing that at least they're all about a week apart and I want to enjoy and live and capture the summer since last year was so shitty.... I'm such a foodie and social eater/drinker and that's when I feel like I enjoy and have fun and lately I feel like I'm a bit of an old bore....

We're talking remote *remote* Highlands. 

I was OK the first day and a half because I'd packed cold meat, hard boiled eggs, nuts, etc., but I had no means to refrigerate and after that, I had to take food where I could get it- petrol station pre-packed sandwiches, chocolate bars, sausage rolls.....

The second night I stayed in a B&amp;B &amp; the owner had laid out a packet of chocolate biscuits beside the coffee machine in my room.

orb3fi,Finally changing my relationship with food,"So ever since I can remember, I’ve always felt a few sizes too big. I’ve never been obviously ‘overweight’, but I’ve also never really been happy with how I look when I’m carrying more weight (especially as I always put weight on around the middle and on my face). When I have been able to lose weight and get to a size that makes me feel good (through exercise and CICO) I’ve always ended up regaining it in the end. Generally, it fluctuates. When work is very busy, for example, I can lose weight quite quickly, but old habits die hard and it comes back eventually. 

Most recently, I lost quite a lot of weight last summer during the lockdown when I was able to run and work out loads. Of course I wasn’t able to maintain this long-term, so following another lockdown and a breakup I now find myself 10kg heavier than I was this time last year. (Maybe this doesn’t sound like a lot, but I can definitely feel it and none of my clothes fit, which makes me feel terrible! I am 32F/166cm/64kg).

This time, however, the weight did NOT seem to be budging no matter what I do. I was being fairly careful with what I eat, I was running longer distances than before, and I had generally been trying to learn to manage my eating habits and not depend on food to soothe boredom, loneliness etc. But old habits die hard and I couldn’t seem to shift that emotional dependence on food and the restrict/binge cycle.

HOWEVER- after a tentative few weeks experimenting with keto, I am starting to feel a shift in my relationship with food that I have never had before. I haven’t been following it to the letter (e.g. I have had a couple of meals out involving carbs and alcohol) but even so I am SO much easily more satisfied by food and do NOT have cravings for sweets/sugars/carbs at all (this is mind blowing to me). When combined with IF (something I have been experimenting with on and off for a year, but have found hard), a keto (even when not super strict) way of dieting seems to be working wonders. It’s easy to stay within my calories/macros, much easier to fast, I have tons more energy and just don’t think about food that much! Exercise is even easier: my running times are better than ever and yesterday I went climbing towards the end of a 19h fast and felt great. I have also finally started to lose some kgs!

I know it’s SUCH early days still but I’m posting this in the hope that I will keep on with this upward trajectory and that this is a permanent change.

Fiber is a gift in plants and is very important to incorporate in a very keto diet as a result of fiber protects gut bacteria, improves biological process operations, and helps forestall constipation.

In the keto diet, the bulk of daily calories come back from fats, whereas lesser amounts come back from proteins. Meat, fish, eggs, and farm feature heavily within the keto diet.

When the body cannot trust carbohydrates for energy, it should burn fat for fuel. This leads to a buildup of acids known as ketones within the body. This leads to a bodily state of ketonemia.

Many people follow a keto set up for a group quantity of your time before sterilization the diet to incorporate a lot of carbohydrates and less fat.

Vegetarian and vegetarian keto meals

It may be difficult for vegetarians and vegans to follow a keto diet, as several of the calories in these diets come back from carbohydrates. Even sources of nonanimal supermolecule, like lentils and beans, are usually comparatively high in carbs.

In the normal keto diet, animal merchandise tends to form up an oversized portion of meals as a result of these foods are naturally high in fat, high in supermolecule, and low in carbohydrates.

Though tough, it’s doable to follow an eater or vegetarian keto diet. people who don’t eat meat or fish will replace these merchandise with high-fat plant-based foods.

Vegetarians can even eat eggs and a few styles of a farm as a part of the diet.

anyway i used to have a **31 inch waist** last year at roughly 150lbs with visible abs **now i have a 26 inch waist no abs at 170lbs**  
that's right my abs are nowhere near as sharp as when i would eat extremely low calorie dense foods but my waist is so much more taught and sharp i'm never bloated and i thought y'all might be interested in some foods i eat regularly to keep my food volume low. so here goes:

1-Olive Parvarde  
it's a Persian food. olives in a paste made from walnut and pomegranate paste. i add some other nuts and a big gulp of coconut oil.

2-microwave Broccoli / Kale  
about half a cup is enough to get your vitamins, drench that shit in ranch

3-literally just oil  
that's right! cook something in the oil, maybe some italian sausages and then serve 80% of the sausage to your S/O and add tomato paste and herbs to the oil and you can lick upwards of 600 calories of oil from the pan like it's the most delicious thing ever

or3eqt,French toast with Franz keto bread is pretty amazing.,"I don't know why I'd never thought of trying French toast with the keto bread. I'm not crazy about that bread for untoasted sandwiches, but I like it ok for toast and especially for grilled cheese. Last week I found allulose maple syrup at QFC (Kroger) and figured I'd try it. 

French toast is the best thing I've done with that bread! I used one egg for two slices and it wasn't quite enough for both slices, so the one that was better-soaked tasted better. It completely got rid of the dryness of the bread and was almost indistinguishable from regular bread. 

To my tastes, the syrup was not awesome but was completely acceptable. Even if I weren't eating keto, I would pick the allulose version over something like full-sugar Aunt Jemima. Although I like allulose better than most sweeteners, it still tastes a little weird/chemical-like to me.",keto,1

or2bit,High resting pulse and blood pressure under Keto,"Hello,

I recently began Keto 3 weeks ago, wanted to try it again, after I tried in the past loosing weight with no luck for years. I am male 37 at 86KG. Feeling very ill and weak since years because of depression but also sleep sleep apnea. I cant do any activities at all, the tiniest amount of activity makes me feel so exhausted and weak that I have to sit down. I bought an ergo meter, but using it just for about 15 minutes on slow/mediocre speed makes me feel so sick (vertigo, weakness, pressure in head, dizziness), that I have to stop. I haven't lost any weight since over 2 years even with trying out diets like eating half and intermediate fasting.

I tried to follow these basic rules per day:

\- under 20g carbs which I couldnt avoid for example in some milk products and yogurt 

\- around 50g protein mostly milk protein and from eggs

\- around 100g fat, 20g of it flaxseed oil for omega 3, a mix of butter, coconut oil, avocados, olive oil, walnuts

\- 2x 250mg magnesium, 3x 500mg potassium, pinch of salt for sodium

\- drink enough, mostly hibiscus tea and water around 3l

\- eat a spinach salad every day: 150g spinach, 1 large avocado, 1 egg, 30g of olive oil, some walnuts, some chicken meat

But now after 3 weeks, I felt so bad in Keto, that I just had to stop it and eat carbs again. A few days later, my pulse and blood pressure normalized and went down.

During keto my resting pulse was always around 100-110 and my blood pressure around 150/100. I also felt even more weak than ever before during the last days of it and it wouldn't become any better.

A few days after eating enough carbs again (over 100g per day), my pulse and blood pressure normalized.

Any advice would be helpful, what I did wrong, or if Keto would just not work for me, and made things even way worse. I read lots about Keto flue, but after 3 weeks things didnt get any better. I tried to take enough magnesium and potassium too and drink enough. I felt weaker and weaker under Keto and had no energy in me at the end, and my pulse and blood pressure were just too high.",keto,1

MCT oil - more rapidly converted to energy as ketones than longer chain fatty acids. Seems to increase peptide YY and leptin, both of which contribute to a feeling of fullness. Also shown to decrease cholesterol, LDL, and increase HDL.",keto,1

oqz6gs,Hydration for the win!!,"Hello! 

Like the title states… water is the key! (In my opinion) 

I think it’s important to share my experience with exploring the relationship between being hydrated and eating low carb and being dehydrated, because the difference is so profound that I think it could be the most important factor in our success with starting or staying on Keto. 

Like a lot of us here, I have been on and off the hamster wheel that is eating low carb or engorging myself with every form of carbohydrate that exists. It’s been a lifelong battle to change my diet habits, I crave sugar daily and will often overindulge because I’m chasing a white dragon that I can’t seem to catch. The trend I’ve noticed is that the more dehydrated I am the more I will crave sugar, salt, and carbs. And the catch is that a diet heavy in those things dehydrated me even more, and the more dehydrated I’d become the more repulsed by water I would be and instead I would turn to the treats and snacks to satisfy the cravings. 

Lately I’ve been deep in that cycle. Usually I am a pretty hydrated person, I enjoy water and don’t drink sugary beverages very often. But lately I’ve been so chronically dehydrated that I was hating the taste of water and constantly craving/eating instead. I’ve been trying for 6 months to jump back into a keto lifestyle but I couldn’t stop the cravings and kept reverting back to sugar. So I made a decision to help break that cycle, and wow! It has changed the whole dynamic in a matter of 3 days. 

What I decided to do is follow 1 simple rule: drink 3 glasses (10 oz each) of water before I allow myself to eat breakfast, 2 glasses of water before I eat lunch, and 1 glass before and after dinner. I have found immediate results with a drastic decrease in my sugar/carb cravings (actually not even craving at all!) and I’m actually capable of making the food choices I want to be making once my water rule is followed. Plus I feel full after eating a meal instead of having that constant nagging for more snacks. 

There have been many positive results that I’ve noticed from my commitment to rehydrating myself, but the power of choice of my food has been the game changer. My self-will had failed me no matter how badly I wanted to stop eating sugar, and now I believe that being dehydrated was truly the most impactful aspect to this issue. Also, I’m loving the taste of water again and drinking even more than the bottom line I’ve set for myself.

oqym5y,Top 3 Reasons Why Carbs Are NOT Bad!," 

Carbs are not bad! I feel as though the closer the warm months get to us, the further away the carbs are... because people start running from them.

This is not only a miserable mentality, but it's not even healthy. Yes, it is actually UNHEALTHY to cut all of your carbs from your diet. With that being said, let's go over the top 3 reasons why it is actually beneficial to have carbs as a part of your diet!

**1) Your metabolism will love you.**

Yes, yes it will! Think about your life as a whole and the things that aren't necessarily great for you, but could also be harmful long-term if you cut them completely out. Let's use germs as an example and the fact that although they are disgusting, our bodies would not be able to build an immunity to anything without them around at some point. There have been studies conducted that have shown over time that kids who played in the dirt etc had a better immune system as adults than kids who were sheltered from all that was germy during their younger years.

Now think about carbs... although you may THINK they are bad (because you were lied to), they are actually becoming bad for you because you are eliminating them. Any person cutting carbs to cut weight faster will eventually suffer from weight GAIN once they go back to ""normal eating"", and may even gain more than what they had to lose in the first place!

Cutting carbs from your diet will cause your metabolism to not recognize them as easily and therefore will forget how to process them efficiently. What does this mean? It means that these excess carbs will rest as stored body fat. The solution? Never eat carbs again... wrong! The solution is to educate yourself on how to eat carbs in the proper and most healthy manner so that they will benefit you and most definitely not hurt you.

**2) You need the energy!**

Count how many times you have heard people on low/no-carb diets complain of being tired, lethargic, etc... now count how many times you've heard people be excited and full of energy, all because of their amazing low carb lifestyle... exactly. Know this: the proteins that you eat can be used for energy, but they are primarily there to maintain your body, help you build muscle, recover from exercise, etc... the healthy fats that you eat are used to combat the bad fats that you eat and are also used as energy at low intensities, such as when you're sleeping. This brings us to carbs and what they provide.

Carbs are used for energy at moderate to higher intensities which depending on your daily activity level can be the majority of the day... they are also there to signal to your body important things such as ""your workout is over, so stop breaking down muscle"" or ""hey I'm here, so use me for energy instead of your proteins... they need to build and recover your body"". These things are important and they in many cases happen through insulin levels, which carbs have a lot of influence on depending on what type they are.

To cut out this opportunity for carbs is to think that you can ""trick"" your body, and to think that is just wrong. I've had multiple clients upon coming to me be at **least** pre-diabetic and just through paying more attention to the types of carbs they are eating and when... this condition has been all but alleviated for them, and this wasn't even the initial goal for them to accomplish!  
Are you eating the correct amount for your goals? Ask a professional for recommendations to know the best dietary choices to make for yourself.

**3) It just makes sense (to your body)!**

Think about the vehicles that we drive. I'm sure that for a pretty decent while cars can run with low or even missing fluids, but would you do this intentionally just because someone told you that your gas mileage may go up as a result? No, you wouldn't. People cut carbs because they are desperate to lose weight fast and someone tells them that this is the way to achieve that. Not only is cutting carbs a miserable process but it is NOT a healthy process.

I have a client that is a medical doctor, and he had an interesting story one day that he ""just had to share"". A woman comes into the ER with complications internally, specifically with her intestinal tract. Upon further testing, scans, etc the problem was found... and it was basically a traffic jam inside of her stomach. The cause? Upon further questioning, it was determined that she had been cutting carbs on a certain ketogenic diet in order to put her body into ketosis and ""lose fat fast"". After a situation like this, the person then has to be reintroduced to carbs so their body can relearn how to use/process them and begin the path back to normality and eventually, health. This happens because cutting carbs just does not make sense to your body, especially for a long period of time.

But recently, I hit a small milestone which allowed me to get under the weight limit of my much faster road bike. I had previously stopped riding it, because I had exceeded the weight limit and didn't feel safe on it anymore. But now with my lower weight, I felt I could ride it again.

Today, I went on another fasted ride on my road bike with about the same amount of water with electrolytes that I normally carry. But I just had so much fun going fast, I forgot to keep my pace slow and steady. I was in zone 3 and 4 for the majority of the time. Didn't care. Was having too much fun going fast again. I was going almost twice as fast, so my stupid self thought I could do twice the distance in the same amount of time. 

Less than halfway through, I noticed I am almost out of water. Uh-oh. Time to turn around.

I took it very easy on the return, but I knew I was in trouble. I was very thirsty and I couldn't pedal harder even if I wanted to. The ride back was way worse than any bonk I have ever experienced. 

I eventually managed to trudge my way home. And then drank some regular water immediately to quench my thirst. I don't know if this worsened it, but I couldn't finish my big mug of water. I felt extremely light headed and felt like I was going to faint. ""Maybe I was just tired?"" I thought.

I sat down on the floor, took off my jersey and just sat there for a few minutes. Felt a little better so I stood up...and immediately felt dizzy and almost blacked out. Sat my backside right back on the floor. This was getting a little scary now. 

I took a small nap on the kitchen floor. Sweaty, in ridiculous looking lycra, probably not the cleanest kitchen floor. Didn't care. 30 minutes passed. Felt better.

I crawled to my mug of water. Dropped an electrolyte tablet in. Drank it. Slept another 10 minutes. Feeling so much better but still light headed. Another electrolyte tablet and water. 

And now I'm fine. 

But that was a scary experience for me. Definitely learned my lesson. Don't overdo the exercise (particularly when in a fasted state), drink plenty of electrolytes, and maybe clean the kitchen floor?

tldr; Overdid it on my bike without getting enough water and electrolytes. Nearly fainted. I am stupid.",keto,1

oqlh27,Best type of exercise during being pre-full fat adapted,"Hi all,

5 weeks into keto, things are going quite well but I think I’m a bit of a slow adapter into being fully fat adapted. My misses just started it and she’s feeling great within 5 days 😂 

I avoided too much exercise to begin with and made sure my electrolytes were being looked after and felt pretty good with steady energy and surprisingly my sleep has been good more often than not…so all in all not doing too bad although I can tell I’m not fully fat adapted yet!

This week I decided to up the exercise and have noticed my body and mind towards the end of the day feeling anxious and twitchy, I blink a lot and feel uncomfortable breathing. Here is what I have been up to….

Tuesday 5km run- felt ok

Wednesday 5x5 workout - barbell squat, bench press, barbell row

Thursday 6km run - breezed it

Friday 5x5 workout - barbell squat, overhead press, deadlift

Saturday 5.5km run - struggled

I felt good on all 5x5 workouts but I feel as though maybe later on I’m suffering because of them.

I’ve heard of zone 2 cardio, I’ll have to research this but I think it’s when you keep yourself in a fat burning heart rate zone?

I remember being FULL of energy on previous bouts of keto (I am looking to make it long term this time) I’m doing alright with work, I am 100% bang on with getting in the office and doing what I need to do…but the moment my working day is over I can’t be assed with housework or anything, one of the reasons I love keto is because shit gets done…I’m just not feeling the full effects yet and wonder whether I need to get the right intensity balance of exercise whilst my body works out what the hell is going on 🤣

oqk855,Keto and CBD oil Metabolism,"Does anyone here take cbd oil and noticed it wears off faster while in ketosis? 

During my break from keto this year I started cbd oil for insomnia because I would wake up in the middle of the night and not be able to go back to sleep.

Now that I started keto again it no longer helps me get back to sleep when I wake up in the middle of the night. I know that’s partially due to electrolyte imbalances but I’ve also noticed I can take a second drop in the middle of the night without negative consequences like before.

oqil8o,Eating lots of fat and some protein but still binging,"TW: eating disorder

Hey, so I've tried to start keto, again and again and again, but I keep failing. Everytime I try to eat, let's say I have some cheese and a tomato and cucumber salad and some chicken for lunch. It would come out to a moderate amount of calories and I would feel somewhat full. Great. But then I get the worst cravings to eat. Basically anything, so it's not really just carbs or sugar. I just can't stop eating unless I feel like I need to purge. And since I've been in the binge/purge cycle before, I know that stuff like cheeses and Fats and protein are hard to throw up so I end up eating a bunch of carbs and stuff to make it ""easier"" and also ""why not because I've already messed up"". 

I thought fat and protein was supposed to curb appetite, but it just doesn't for me. Perhaps I have some sort of medical condition I don't know about, or a psychiatric thing? (I have bulimia but undiagnosed)

oqci83,Balancing a caloric deficit with proper nutrition and calorie out estimates/tracking apps,"Hello Folks,

I'm fairly new to the keto world but so far am loving it. I have been a bit puzzled though by trying to figure out the optimal amount of calories to consume based on my bmr and activity level.

I've noticed that my fit bit tracker has a weird calculation for the number of calories burned through exercise, so instead I've been using my own estimate to input into cronometer to figure out my total energy expenditure. I've seen some people to stick with sedentary levels for macros but I'm worried that if I do that and continue to exercise, I'll experience issue building and maintain healthy muscle and nutrition.

I would love to hear people's thoughts though:
Should I still try and strive for my base bmr level caloric intake + my deficit for weight loss at sedentary levels most of the time? 
or 
is it important to eat more and increase caloric intake on days where I'm heavily active through calorie out estimates? 

For context, I've been doing pretty strict keto for almost a month now and lost about 10lbs- a lot of which was likely water weight. Weight loss isn't a huge goal for me with keto- I'm aiming for about 10 lbs more pounds and am mostly on the diet for the anti-inflammatory effects. Also, I've recently been increased my exercise level and would like to continue to do so over time but have noticed some pretty intense muscle pain due to being so out of shape from covid. I have been supplementing with ketoade to try and combat this. This leads me to think that I should increase my caloric intake based on a reasonable estimate of expenditures through exercise, but I don't want to over do it.

I'm feedback or thought on this from others on how to balance a deficit and strict macro regime with caloric output estimates would be greatly appreciated :)

oq8r2a,NSV: Half Marathon,"I started eating keto around September of last year.  I was more or less sedentary.  At the same time, I started jogging daily to compliment my dieting weight loss efforts.  You know, just a little bit, to the end of the block, to the next cul-de-sac, to the next intersection.  Little by little I ran further and further.  If the weather was bad I took the day off, but I did get some cold weather workout gear so the overall air temperature wouldn't bother me in the winter.  It also helped having all of the extra 'built in insulation'.  I generally focused on distance and not speed.  I found a route that I liked for after work jogs.  Over time, I started finishing that distance quicker.  I would try for a longer run on the weekends as time allowed.  


I eventually started incorporating bicycling for cardio as I developed a case of runners knee.  To be fair, my knees were straight up abused with all of the exercise I was doing while being so heavy.  I did go to my doctor about the knee and got a PT regimen that worked out great.  Lots of hip and stability muscle work. I did only bicycling for a few weeks and gradually brought back the running, with a new pair of Brooks of course.  I still can't believe I wore out a pair of quality running shoes.  Currently I try to run no more than 50% of my cardio sessions.  


Seasons changed and I had to switch to the hot weather gear and really pay attention to electrolytes because I sweat a lot.  


As an aide, I feel like I made a connection with all of the 'regulars' on my cardio route.  I kind of always liked the mutual wave or head nod.  Completely different people of all shapes and sizes all getting their exercise in for whatever the reason.  It's as if I know them without ever having spoke a single word outside of pleasantries.  I also liked this at the gym but Covid upended that.  Maybe I think too much into it but it makes me happy.  They have been there through it all, all the way down to my current weight at 189 pounds.  


Anyways, sorry for rambling, point is, I ran 13.2 miles this morning @ 2hr 17min (10' 16"" pace).  Longest I have ever run in my life.  I did 10 miles a month ago and thought, what's another half hour so I could get one of those bumper stickers 😂.  I ran fasted (except for a cup of black coffee) with a 2.5L CamelBak with salt and lite salt mixed in.  Sipped it throughout.  Once I got home, I crushed an LMNT chocolate electrolyte mix and a Vega Sport Protein mix.  I still feel dehydrated and will keep on drinking ketoade for the rest of the day.  


No finish line, no banner, no goodie bag, no snapshots, but, I did it.  Somewhat anticlimactic but that's how it is.

oq1wv9,Reliance on physicians,"I read so many posts about physicians being less than encouraging relative to keto.  And also see so many podcasts and videos describing how typical western medical approaches (a pill for every ill...) really miss the mark, particularly in the chronic illness/metabolic syndrome era.  I find I have simply stopped going to ""the doctor"" since I have gone keto - in addition to following the basics of sleeping well, moving well, and managing stress.  I am over 60, but have never felt better and weigh less than I did in high school.  I am retired but tend towards moving/exercising/working too much as opposed to not enough (I work out every day, walk, ride my bike, swim, etc. in addition to ""chores"" around my little ranchette).  My tendency toward ""over-exercise"" resulted in plantar fasciaitis (sic) over the past year from which I am still recovering (and did treat with physicians and alternate care specialists fwiiw)...and I have to work to keep this tendency in check. 

I just wonder how much of an outlier this position of non use of doctors is in this community?""  For what it is worth, I am not encouraging this approach and I would not hesitate to go to a doc/emergency room for an acute situation like broken bones or auto accident (or the foot issue I mentioned above).  However, I have just come to rely on how I feel as my guide to medical care requirements as opposed to going to see a doc every 6 months for a physical.  I also have little faith in pharmaceuticals curing anything - and my foot experience has only sustained that perception.  Finally, I guess I also see this as ancestrally appropriate/justified as prior to say the last 150 years, there were no/few physicians to turn to for the guidance that we seem to rely on so intensely in the modern era.  And it saves a bunch of $...the most worthless money I've spent in the past year has been on treatment for my foot issues - outside of the orthotics which did help.  Everything else did nothing.

INGRIDENTS

 **Hamburger Or Ground Beef, 85% Lean** ( **2 pounds**)

 **Marinara Sauce by Rao's Homemade** ( **24 ounce** )

 **Extra Virgin Olive Oil** ( **2 tablespoon** )

 **Garlic, Fresh** ( **4 clove** )

  **Salt** ( **½ teaspoon** )

 **Italian Seasoning** ( **1 teaspoon** )

 **Basil, Dried** ( **½ teaspoon** )

 **Cabbage, Green, Raw** ( **6 cup, chopped** )

 **Basil** ( **1 tablespoon, chopped** )

 

## Cooking Directions

 

**Step 1**

Heat olive oil in a large pan or pot over medium heat. Once hot, add the ground beef, breaking it up with a spatula or spoon.  
  

**Step 2**

While the beef is cooking, slice a head of green cabbage. Cut the bottom of the cabbage off, then slice the head in half vertically. Cut each half in half again, then cut out the core. Thinly slice each quarter until you have thin shreds that look like noodles.  

**Step 3**

Add the garlic, salt, italian seasoning and basil to the meat. Once it is about halfway to being fully cooked, add in the jar of Rao’s sauce. Bring to a boil and reduce the heat to medium-low.  
  

**Step 4**

Add the shredded cabbage to the beef and toss with a pair of tongs. Once the cabbage is somewhat coated in the tomato and beef mixture, reduce the heat to medium-low and mostly cover the pan with a lid, just leaving a small crack for heat to escape and reduce. Allow the mixture to simmer for about 7-10 minutes, or until the cabbage softens.  
  

**Step 5**

Allow the mixture to simmer for about 7-10 minutes, or until the cabbage softens. Remove the lid from the pan and allow to cook for a few more minutes to evaporate any liquid that was released from the cabbage. Top with chopped basil and serve!",keto,1

2nd time on Keto, my goal is weight loss &amp; possible benefits for narcolepsy.

**Sooo I'm having a question regarding short-term keto diets:**

I'm not in urgent need of losing weight and currently, I'm very able to keep my current weight and maintain a fairly clean and unprocessed diet that does contain carbs (like potatoes, carrots, occasional beans etc.). Basically my lunch and breakfast are keto, as well as 2 cheat meals a week.  


I'm intrigued by ""going full keto"" for a limited amount of time to eventually lose some excess kilos and to find out what the diet can do for my hormonal status, sleep, energy level etc. . However, I'm quite sure that I will not be able to strictly keep a keto diet. And quite frankly, I'm enjoying my current diet very much. 

What might be important is that I plan all my meals two weeks ahead and calculate the recipes down to a gram (except the two cheat meals of course!), so I will probably be able to slowly increase the amount of carbs in my diet without overeating. 

**My Questions:**

1. Has anyone ever done a short-term keto diet and succesfully kept the weight (of course, some water will come back but hey - I'm not a body builder so that's fine!)
2. Will the insuline-sensitivity increase during keto, hence leading to a ""rebound""?
3. If this is possible - how long should my keto-cycle be?

I couldn't find any clear sources on these questions so I'd be very happy to hear from more experienced keto-veterans.",keto,1

(I know that seems way to quick and I agree now but I never once felt sick or weak, the benefits of youth) I didn't really count carbs so much as I just didn't eat bread, rice or anything of the sort, I also just ate very small portions of food constantly durig the day. Now yes that was 20 years ago and my body is not as young so this will be more of an adjustment. I also know that I won't loose the weight as fast. 

Currently I am short and chubby at 5ft, 162lbs with most of the weight being in my bum and tummy. I am mostly sedentary, but I do have a Fitbit and am trying to get at least 10k steps a day.

&gt;Dear Ms &lt;surname &gt;  
Thank you for contacting the Europe Direct Contact Centre.  
We have consulted the Directorate General for Food Safety and Public Health. Please find below the answer to your question  
  
&gt;  
&gt;""Thank you for your inquiry. On 17 May 2017, an application for the authorisation of Monk fruit extract as a food additive, in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 and the procedure laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1331/2008, was sent to the European Commission.  Following receipt of that application, the Commission sought the opinion of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) in accordance with Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 1331/2008. In November 2019, EFSA published its scientific opinion on the safety of use of Monk fruit extract as a food additive in different food categories ([https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/pub/5921](https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/pub/5921)). The European Food Safety Authority could not establish a health base,d guidance value and concluded that the toxicity database on Monk fruit extract was insufficient to conclude on the safety of the use of Monk fruit extract as a food additive.  
   
&gt;  
&gt;Amongst other conditions for inclusion of use of food additives in the Union list, it follows from Article 6(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 that a food additive may be included in the Union lists in Annex II and III only if “it does not, on the basis of the scientific evidence available, pose a safety concern to the health of the consumer at the level of use proposed”. The Commission services have taken the opinion of the Authority regarding the product in question into account.  Without prejudice to other conditions for inclusion and use of food additives in the Union lists, the Commission services considered that the absence of safety concern regarding the use of Monk fruit extract as a food additive is not established and that the requested update of the Union list is not justified. The common authorization procedure is therefore ended.""  
   
&gt;  
&gt;We hope you find this information useful. Please contact us again if you have other questions about the European Union, its activities or institutions.",keto,1

Any time I visit home, it's pretty much guaranteed that the first comment will be ""Look how skinny you are!"" While normally this would be a compliment, we are a cooking/eating family and getting thin while not shoveling food down your gullet is a bit taboo, especially if your diet turns into a permanent lifestyle change. I appreciate my mom taking the effort to cook things to accommodate my diet, but she keeps trying to make me eat more than I need to. I regularly do weekend water fasts (maybe 2x a month) for a flush to be sure I stay on track, and my mother flips out saying I shouldn't starve myself or that I need to eat while shoving food in my face, and if I don't she'll give me this disappointed, dirty look.

Mind, she will ""cheer me on"" while throwing her non keto meals in my face, something I find contradictory and rude, personally. You know, like at Mexican restaurants she'll tell me how awful her margarita is while shlorping it to the bottom of the glass. I'm not telling her not to eat in front me or anything of the sort, but maybe don't throw it in my face that I can't eat like I used to.

I understand that she cares, but I've had to tell her repeatedly that I'm not harming myself on this diet and I'm not tying my worth to a number on the scale (that she hides when I'm home because I will check). It's important to note that I also have Sickle Cell SS (not the trait, full blown) and I find that I feel better and deal with fewer crises with this diet. 

Still, the fact that I'm not eating like I used to upsets her, I think, and I don't know how else to tell her I'm fine and her fears are unfounded, but also her flaunting foods she knows I can't eat is a little on the rude side. My biggest cheerleader is also, in a way, my biggest bully. Has anyone else had this issue? What did you do to solve it? 

Thanks!",keto,1

opc5vu,Need advice on losing small % of body fat,"Good afternoon, fellow redditors. I am a completely physically healthy male, 175cm short and 70-72kg fat, according to the calculator I found online my % of body fat is 12.9 which is considered quite fine, and some resources even say that I should see my abs by now. However, the reality is far away from the numbers, I have always been skinny fat even when I worked out due to poor diet choice and unqualified personal trainers who just wanted to suck money out of me and did not provide me with training plans that are effective enough. This summer I tried really low carb diet with daily weight training with a kettlebell (16kg), and doing deadlifts with some old barbell that I found in my country house’s garage. However I was aiming to bulk a little first and my arms, shoulders and back look a bit better now for sure. Unfortunately, due to my non-existent willpower I gave up for nearly two weeks and now I wanna get on track. So I decided to workout every day again and remove carbs completely except for fresh vegetables. Logically enough I don’t feel much energy and my workout performance is reducing, so if anyone has been in such situation, what will be your advice on how to proceed with losing the final parts of belly fat? It’s not big, but it still exists and I don’t want it to. I’ve never seen my abs and I think it’s time for us to meet. Thanks to everyone who replies in advance.

opbgft,Maltitol completely preventing weight loss?,"To begin, I eat keto under 1900 calories and 25 carbs, and eat more fat than protein each day. Everything is logged/measured/weighed.

With that said, here's something that defies all logic. Every time I eat any sugar free maltitol-based products, I stop losing weight. Sure it might raise my blood sugar, but that means you'd just gain water weight and start losing weight again with that water weight there, right? But that doesn't happen. If I eat 1-2 maltitol products per week, I'd stay in a complete stall and not lose anything until I stop eating them.

It makes no sense. Really my only conclusions are:

1. These sugar-free candy companies are lying about the actual caloric content
2. Eating in a caloric deficit doesn't make you lose weight per se and there are other factors.
3. There's some biblical untested side effect of maltitol that prevents your body from burning calories.

I often read that ""Keto is expensive"", could you explain why? Is it because you have access to ready meals or products that call themselves ""Keto"" or because you don't cook much?

op958r,Using Carb Manager or Calculo for macros,"Hello all.

F34 167cm SW 66kg CW 59kg GW 57kg 

Just changed from My Fitness Pal to Carb Manager due to recommendations in this sub and have a couple of questions:

- I calculated my macros on Calculo (as per the wiki) but Carb Manager recommends different values. I know these are customisable and there isn’t a huge deal of difference (about 100 cals), but should I be using Calculo or CM for macros?

- Would you recommend less of a deficit now that I am almost at my GW? This is the only way I’ve managed to lose weight healthily so want to ensure I do it sustainably. 

- CM enables exercise tracking but I couldn’t see a calorie adjustment. I want to ensure I’m eating enough. Should I adjust for this manually? Is there a setting I just haven’t activated? 

Thank you to everyone in this sub for the incredible advice so far. I have never felt so good and the consistent NSVs I’m experiencing are worth the cost of admission alone!

I mean that realization had already been there for a while, but the picture of me with all of the attendees I realized I was the heaviest person there by at least 100 pounds. It was humiliating. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know if anyone else has this same problem, but in my head I am the same weight I was in highschool: 145 lbs and a borderline size seven/eight. So when I see my self in photos, or in the mirror over and over again I'm shocked. However it feels so good now and gratifying to realize that every single day I am doing something about that problem. It feels good to know that if I were to go to the doctor I wouldn't be embarrassed about my weight because I can now say this is what I'm doing about it to solve this problem. I haven't had sugar/bread/high carb items (unless you count my weekly banana that I allow myself on the weekends lol!) since June 26th. And for the past five days since I saw 264 on the scale, I have been obsessively weighing myself at all times of day for the past two days because it does not feel real. Guys, 270 lbs is gone for good and today I finally accepted that. I am doing this, I am living a ketogenic lifestyle. For the first time in my life, instead of just investing in the stock market I am investing in myself. I still cringe when I go grocery shopping sometimes because I was so used to buying cheap processed foods full of sugar, and sometimes the healthier option is pricy but I am investing in myself, my future, and my future family so that I can be there for them. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am amazed at who I have become. I mean, it's been almost a month of this and it's not hard anymore. It just feels like this is my life. I make my own meals, I check labels, I get angry at the people who decided to add sugar to dried cranberries (I mean really people? really?). I'm also making connections for example, before I would go oh 14 grams of added sugar that's not bad. Today, I think well might as well sprinkle a tablespoon of sugar on this meal because that's already what they've added to it. I'm eating nuts, and seeds, and sugar free yogurt with cocoa powder. Heck, I made a ""granola"" bar the other day that had like six types of nuts and seeds in it and oh my gosh it tastes AMAZING. Just one month ago I would have taken a bite and probably spit it out.",keto,1

I am a male 5´10 SW: 286, CW 227 lbs.  and I have been on  keto/if for the past 5 months. I have a appointment with my doctor next month, when completing the 6 months in keto.   

Have lost 59 lbs in the journey, and have drawn blood EVERY 30 days for a lipid profile. All markers have been improving the past 4 months: HDL from  37 to 50, LDL from 140 to 127, Tryglycerids from 144 to 84. But yesterdays numbers were HDL 48, LDL 184, TG: 530 !!!   I did not expect this high in TG. So i did another 24 hours later and the results were: HDL 43, LDL:114, TG:216

Have you had any experience with this?  I am feeling better everyday, my blood pressure is on optimal levels: 117/75  (I used to take meds)

I had a regular dinner the night before, some eggs with steak and avocado.  How could the TG change so much in 24 hours?   and also goin from 83 to 530 in 30 days while losing weight and every other markers constantly improving?   Is there something else should I be worried?   when is a good time to have another lipid test?

I've been following keto on and off for around 6 years and I've always had good results.
I've always used it as a means to get my weight under control if it gets too high, but this time around I just can't seem to get any weight off.

I was 5lbs off my goal weight in October 2019, but then I went on holiday and fell off the wagon, and my weight has slowly crept up. I'm now 2.5 stone heavier. 

Over the last couple of months I've tried a few times to get back into keto, but after a week of no weight loss I generally lose faith and binge eat.

My latest endeavour, I did 11 days of keto and didn't lose any weight at all. I even did some exercise that week and actually put on weight, which I cannot understand at all. 
Then I had 3 days off, and started an egg fast. I'm 3 days into an egg fast and again I've lost nothing :(
I've cut out drinking alcohol all together, I'm definitely under my calories so I just can't understand it.
The only thing that has really changed is my age, and the fact that I've been prescribed prozac recently.

Does anyone have any advice at all that could help me?

I'm not very good at wording questions as I tend to ramble so apologies if I have, but I guess I'm just after some help.

One slice of bacon
Two eggs
One teaspoon pesto
1 cup spinach
A drizzle of olive oil
About a teaspoon of butter
And a slight sprinkling of feta or goat cheese

I know the feta isn't exactly keto from what I've read, but I use just a tiny bit of it and it's amazing. This meal has two g carbs, 24 G of fat, 20 G protein and 300 calories.

Cook the bacon, wipe out most of the grease from the pan, add olive oil, wilt your spinach with some salt. On the side whip up your eggs with the pesto then add to the wilted spinach. Crumble up your bacon into half inch bits, add that in there, mix it all up till it's cooked and top with a little bit of cheese of your choice. I used feta.

It's really delicious, I'm honestly eating my last bite as I typed this. I'm on a pretty low calorie diet so I only used the two eggs, but naturally you can increase this based on what you prefer.

I got on the scale for the first time since 2017 and nearly passed out! I was 32lbs heavier than on my wedding day! It didn't help that like a lot of other people during COVID, I became a bread making master.

I was doing a calorie counting diet for 6 weeks and lost only 4lbs. It was very frustrating. My work partner was and still is doing Keto with intermittent fasting. Both concepts scared me as I am not a fan of meat nor what I felt was deliberate starvation with the fasting. Since my calorie counting was not working, I decided to try her method.

I started on a Wednesday and chose to weigh myself once a week on Sundays. Previously I was weighing myself daily, which wasn't good to watch the scale barely move over the calorie counting first 6 weeks. I downloaded the Carb Manager app and from the first Wednesday to the first Sunday weigh in, I lost 3lbs! The next Sunday weigh in, 5lbs down! The next weigh in there was no loss, but no gain. I was still encouraged by that and now I have ordered the apps companion cookbook from Amazon which should arrive today. I'm excited!

In all I've lost 12lbs with my greatest success being when I started Keto and intermittent fasting.

I deliberately did not start an exercise routine because I have never liked exercise (I'm such a wimp!) and knew I couldn't maintain it. So my husband and I walk. Plus I am a hard-core gardener so that helps.

oollif,“Eating processed meat raises risk of heart disease by a fifth”,"Just saw this latest study in the Guardian. The bias of the researcher in leading with the greenhouse gas emissions isn’t even subtle. But is anyone here concerned by this?

[https://www.theguardian.com/food/2021/jul/21/eating-processed-meat-raises-risk-heart-disease-fifth-bacon](https://www.theguardian.com/food/2021/jul/21/eating-processed-meat-raises-risk-heart-disease-fifth-bacon)

Eating processed meat raises the risk of heart disease by a fifth, according to the largest ever analysis of research into the impact of meat consumption on cardiac health.

Researchers at the University of Oxford are urging the public to cut their red and processed meat consumption by three-quarters, or to give it up entirely, to lower their risk of dying from coronary heart disease.

The team found that **eating 50g of processed meat, including bacon, ham and sausages, increased the risk of heart disease by 18%** owing to its high salt and saturated fat content.

This fell to 9% for unprocessed red meat, such as beef, lamb and pork, but **there was no link found between heart disease and eating poultry**, such as chicken and turkey, which are lower in saturated fat.

Anika Knüppel, a co-lead author of the study, said: “**We know that meat production is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions** and we need to reduce meat production and consumption to benefit the environment. Our study shows that a reduction in red and processed meat intake would bring personal health benefits too.” 

She added that there was no agreement on what constituted a safe level, and instead recommended consuming as little as possible, with once a week a possible maximum. She urged policymakers to strengthen public health guidelines to encourage more people to limit their processed red meat intake.

While the research did not establish the reasons for the link, it is thought that high intakes of saturated fat increase levels of harmful low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, while excess salt consumption raises blood pressure, both of which are present in high quantities in processed meat and are well-established risk factors for coronary heart disease.",keto,1

Forgive me if this is a common question. I started keto about a month ago, 20g carbs a day. I noticed significant water weight loss in the first week or two, as well as an inch or more lost pretty much everywhere on my body. However, since then I have been steadily losing weight at a slower (but still significant) rate but the tape measure isn’t budging. Maybe I’m being too impatient, but I worry I’m losing muscle instead, or perhaps it’s just visceral fat. I’m interested to know if you guys have had similar experiences, or if you know what could be up. When did you start noticing consistent smaller measurements? And please, feel free to tell me it’s too early and that I need to stop freaking out.",keto,1
ooi4nt,Keto and HbA1c,"So I did a HBA1C  blood test. It basically measures how much sugar level was the last three months. The normal  should be lower than 5.6%. 

So last year without any diet or anything, it was 5.7%. 
This year I have been doing keto+ fasting+ calorie count  from April till June I would say( I stopped because my weight platueued).
I did my HBA1C yesterday and it was 5.5%. so keto helped someway. I am planning to improve it more. 

The only problem I have right now is that my LDL is higher than normal and Keto mainly depends on fat.

How am I supposed to balance this? 
I would like to mention that I don't work out because I get extremely tired at my job that when I get home I don't have energy to move. Also I don't eat or like sea food which is a main source of omega three that can help lower LDL. I tried the capsules and they made me itchy for some reason and it give weird taste. The liquid form was atrocious and I still get nauseous whenever I remember the taste. 

Do you think if i try  to work out while doing  keto, I will see good results regarding my LDL? Or should I look for a different diet? Has anyone had this issue before

ooi35l,"Anti-Inflammatory Keto: tips, approach, pain, fatigue","My functional/TCM doc has me on a combo keto + anti-inflammatory diet for 4 weeks: basically keto with no dairy, no nuts, no veggies etc. of any kind. Basically eating all kinds of meat / seafood, olives, avocado, duck eggs, and kelp noodles (cooked / slathered with good fats). I can explain the reasoning if anyone's interest but don't think it's relevant for this post.

Going into day 6 and still feelign incredibly lethargic. Also intermittent pains, sometimes in the appendix area, lots of (painful) bloating. Nothing so severe I'd see a doctor about it, but concerning. Is still typical / expected when net carbs drop below 15 or 10g / day? I'd estimate I'm \~10g / day with under 2g of that being sugar (from 1 or 2 avocados).

I wasn't expecting much of a 'shock' because I was low carb going before hand. Similar diet, but with some berries, coconut butter, maybe a small apple, select veggies (zucchini, cauliflower, mushrooms, carrots, etc.) 

I'm also off coffee so have been having lots of matcha... I have 1 or 2 ""good"" high functioning hours in the late afternoon and otherwise my work productivity is anywhere from 0 to 30% of where it would otherwise be.... likely part of the course!!

oohmrj,Day #80. Lurking no longer. First post of appreciation and progress.,"I have been lurking since April when I started to consider keto. This community has been so helpful and encouraging. The posts and replies have been a part of my daily routine and I just wanted to express my appreciation. Those of you who have posted your progress have encouraged me, challenged me and led me to post my own story. I hope my story of slow progress might help encourage someone else on their journey. 

My whole life has been a struggle with weight. From shopping in the ""husky"" section as a kid to never really ever feeling comfortable about my weight as an adult. There have been ups and downs as well as many failed attempts. Well some attempts worked at losing weight but failed at being a sustainable lifestyle. Like many of you I have tried it all. I have tried some things that I enjoyed like the Mediterranean Diet and some things that were really dangerous like giving myself appetite suppressing shots daily. 

Keto for me was really a last ditch effort to find something that would be sustainable and that would work. I had an annual physical on 5 APR and it just confirmed what I was afraid of. I had gained 22 pounds during the pandemic. Obviously you are all familiar with the stress caused by the pandemic but in addition to that stress my baby had to undergo a very serious operation which led me to eat my emotions often.

Today is day 80 and I am proud of myself. For the most part I have enjoyed learning about Keto, finding new recipes and being a part of this community. Like many of you I have had my share of NSVs that I would to share with you:

* The other day I was walking with my fam and wore some shorts that had been too tight before Keto. I chose not to wear a belt but ended up having to hold my shorts up on our walk because they kept falling down.
* The other day in the shower my wedding band fell off because it isn't tight around my hot dog finger any more. 
* I am on the last loop on my belt and may need to make a new loop soon. I may turn this into a full family celebration but not sure yet. 
* I don't have as many anxious thoughts as I did prior to begging keto. I really think that there is something that benefitted my brain on this journey. 
* I am proud of myself. Proud of the 80 mark. Proud of what I look like in the mirror now. Proud my kids get to see their dad be dedicated to something that is as much about them as it is me. 
* My wife and I did keto together in May and had a great time working out eating plans. 
* I have loved being more active and have done some things I never thought I would do like 7 mile walks with a friend and 6 mile bike ride with two oldest kids.
* I have a follow up weigh in with my doctor in early August and I am excited to go in knowing I have lost weight. 

I am 43M about 5'9. My starting weight was roughly 280 with scale at Dr appt in APR saying 284. This morning I weighed in at 265.2. That is no where near the eye popping numbers that some people post but they are numbers I am proud of. I have come to appreciate the slow and steady nature of my journey. I hope this might encourage someone else as so many of you have encouraged me! KCKO

I'm 36, male, 217 lbs.

I did keto two years with awesome success. Lost 35 pounds, felt amazing. The transition into ketosis for ne was mostly about two days of feeling tired and brain fog, then felt amazing then on.

Three times in the past couple months I've tried to live keto again. The first time, I made it to day 4 and then had a crushing headache and vomiting to the point of dry heaving. I decided to stop for a bit. Tried again a couple weeks later and endured the same.

So I did my research and realized it was likely sodium and electrolyte imbalance. Tried keto again two weeks ago.
Day 4 hit and as the headache came on, I had a good glass with salt in it. Made sure I was eating leafy greens (kale mainly). I felt great after an hour and charged on.

Day 7 hit and the crushing headache came on. I vomited and vomited. Tried the salty water but no effect. I couldn't even keep it down and vomited it back up. By afternoon I gave in, ate some carbs, and started feeling better. I felt so awful. I lost two days of work from it.

I really want to live keto again as I felt so good on it that first time and lost so much weight. It also made my headaches go away and cured my acid reflux. But I can't keep enduring those hell days where I'm so sick I can't even drink water.

Any advice, or has anyone else endured such an awful transition not even being able to keep down water?",keto,1

I just ran an Ideal Weight calculation (random Google result site) and here’s what it said (apologies for formatting): 

Formula	Ideal Weight
Robinson (1983)	150.2 lbs
Miller (1983)	150.3 lbs
Devine (1974)	153.3 lbs
Hamwi (1964)	156.4 lbs
Healthy BMI Range	123.5 - 166.8 lbs

ooaoex,It's finally happening,"Writing this from a new account because of how self-conscious I feel talking about this.

At the beginning of April, I put myself on a scale that I had been avoiding, saw that it read 269, and decided that I had finally had enough of being obese. I embarked on my first serious diet ever. I started counting calories and put myself on a calorie-restricted diet. The diet held, but the weight wasn't really coming off—it was *so slow*, to the point of being discouraging.

A month ago, I decided to switch to keto, and it's changed everything. My desire for food is totally different—hell, my sense of addiction itself is totally different. It doesn't feel like a constant struggle to keep this up. I feel confident that I'll be able to make it to my target weight of 175, even though that's still months, possibly a year away. The keto flu definitely tripped me up, but I'm through it and feeling good.

I have a medical scale to keep myself motivated. You need to first set the broad weight range with one slide (0, 50, 100, etc.) and then narrow it down with a second slider. For the entire diet, I've been starting by setting the big slider to 250—but this morning, I was able to set it to 200 instead. I'm only at 249.9, but mentally I'm in a new, better place. I'm less than a little slide away from just being ""overweight."" For the first time in my life, I feel like I have control of my body.

I have arthritis - which is the main reason why I started keto. I have both PsA and Osteoarthritis. The Osteo is so bad in my right knee, that according to the ortho I saw, I need a knee replacement very soon. The ortho was kind of a dick about my weight, but I have to admit that he was one of the reasons I was like... maybe I should try to alter my diet. And wow. Keto made a huge impact within 2 weeks on my joint pain... so needless to say I'm all in.

About 3 weeks ago, I went back to see the ortho for the first time since I've started keto. I was so excited for him to see my weight loss, and to have him acknowledge my work! Well, the exact opposite happened. It's like he had no idea who I was, and as I was leaving, he said - you know, your knee would do a lot better if you lost weight. I said - You haven't even noticed - I've lost 50 pounds since March!!?! He basically ignored me and continued to give me weight loss tips! I was pissed. And also a little dejected.

I tried to not let it effect me, but I have been in a little funk since then. But, today I had my every 6 month check up with my Rheumatologist. The first thing he said was - you certainly are NOT a candidate for knee replacement (based on my knee mobility and age). And I told him the story of the ortho - and he was shocked. He kept asking - you've lost 50 pounds since MARCH? You are amazing! That's remarkable! He made me feel great and confidant and reaffirmed that I'm doing the right thing. He said the only reason that I would need a knee replacement is if I lost mobility in my knee. So I asked how that happened - and he said - well, by becoming a couch potato - which you certainly are not (in addition to keto, I do cardio 5 -6 days a week, strength training 3 times, swim 2 times and deep water aerobics 2 times a week).

I know keto works for me as I've lost a bit on it before but since then have gained that and more.

So far I'm 7 weeks in and I've lost 8.8kg (19.4lbs/1.4st). I've taken two weekends off during that time when I had whatever I wanted and I've not given up social drinking, just switched to gin. I know it's good results, especially not being 100% strict! I've lost the lockdown weight, for one.

It's pretty good progress and I should be happy and motivated but I have so much to lose that it still feels pointless if that makes sense? Or not pointless. Too hard. Not worth it. All of those things. Even if my weightloss continues at this rate (and I know it drops off with less to lose) it will take 10 months to get to a 'healthy' bmi, a weight I've not been since being a teenager.

I'm terrified that all this denial and hard mental work will only result in loose skin, saggy boobs and me hating my body even more. How do I keep myself positive about this?

But since I haven't felt any noticeable discomfort in my body so far, i plan to continue keto for an extended period of time.

I've been eating the same stuff everyday, avocado, nuts, flax, lots of greens, a serving of meat (mostly fish and chicken but occasionally beef and goat), a couple tbs of olive oil, and a little cheese, onion, garlic, tomato lime juice.

onztd3,Doctor wants me to lose more weight instead of inches.,"Hey everyone. The title says it all. 

Background: my old pcp left the practice. He was super supportive of my keto lifestyle and knew I was going places with it. The new doctor made a request that I stop keto cuz it could have dire consequences if I continue it. Such as I could get afib like my family has and I could have a heart attack. Needless to say I'll prolly be changing doctors. 

Yet while I may be changing doctors cuz this lady seems to be more interested in my major weight loss transformation than understanding that I'm at a plateau. I do know I need to reduce my fat a lil more to get things rolling again. I explained that plateauing is normal after a few months. With any weight loss experience! But she explained that plateaus are ok but at being 308 isn't a healthy thing. 

I get it I especially am frustrated at having a plateau after only 16 lbs weight loss. It seems some people are dropping weight like flys and I'm sitting here losing inches instead. Yes I do ab exercises and kickboxing so I know I'll be possibly be gaining muscle in the long run. Yet its discerning to see people who dont exercise and they lose 100lbs in 6 months. So I guess I'm mad at myself for not being as able to do that. And now I've got a new doc who's more worried about my weight loss than I am. I'm not giving up though!

We’re getting married in early September, so we agreed we would break our ketosis state and eat wedding 🎂. If we are happy with our weight, should we get back into ketosis after? Or should we just try to maintain a low carb but not ketosis diet?

**One main Result of Eating Whole Grains**

As if you required a reason to go a healthy loaf of whole-grain bread, a replacement study has discovered however powerful intake a healthy quantity of whole grains each day square measure typically to your health. we've got got the precise quantity the researchers recommend you have to be compelled to eat, with the intriguing mechanism behind this physiological result.

For a replacement study revealed this past week inside the peer-reviewed Journal of Nutrition, a team of nutrition medicine researchers from Tufts and Harvard universities analyzed the diet habits of 3,100 people. beginning once the study participants were in their fifties, the researchers checked in once each four years over an associate 18-year span to assemble medical knowledge from them.

A prevailing finding among the study population was that people United Nations agency Greek deity 3 or additional daily servings of whole grains over the 18-year amount old ""a lower average increase in waist size (a half-inch compared to a minimum of one inch) and a bigger decline in lipoid levels throughout every four-year amount,"" in step with. This was compared to a gaggle United Nations agency Greek deity however a half-serving day after day.

Also for the whole grain-eating set, will increase were lower blood sugar levels and heartbeat signs (which, in step with a Harvard, is additional prevalently associated with heart disease and stroke than is heartbeat blood pressure).

The reasons behind these effects of whole grains, as a result of the researchers, make a case for them, appear convincing. once it involves blood sugar, study author Caleigh Sawicki, Ph.D., MPH explained: ""Soluble fiber particularly might have a useful result on post-meal blood sugar spikes.""

As for the weight-related edges of intake whole grains, Sawicki suggests that they have a ""satiating effect"" which can inspire people to eat less. Sawicki conjointly explains that the heartbeat sign was lower owing to the antioxidants and minerals, like metal and metal, that stay in these foods once the grain is left whole.

Look on the facet panel of whole-grain alimentary paste, cereal, rice, and different foods to figure out one serving size, keeping in mind that a portion of food is taken under consideration ""whole grain"" once every serving consists of 0.5 associate oz of those grains.

onknab,"3 Weeks in! Hopefully I can provide a couple of tips, but I also have a couple questions.","**Goals**

I'm about 3 weeks into keto (34M/5'10"", SW: 225 lbs, CW: 215 lbs) and am proud of myself for being completely compliant (with an asterisk, I'll come back to this). I never got the keto flu, have had a couple of tired/exhausted days, but overall I would say my energy level is higher than it was on a high-carb diet. I lift weights 4 days/week (still within noob lift numbers) and run 2-3 days/week, which I need to start doing for longer distances for an upcoming team relay in September. I was quite surprised I was able to perform at the same intensity as pre-keto! That said, ultimately my goal is to lose fat. I've gained about 60 lbs since 2016, may have put on a bit of muscle, but it's mostly fat. There's a NSFW photo from the back in my profile if you feel so inclined to see. My first goal is to get back down to about 190 and see how things look and feel from there.

I haven't noticed the sleep benefits yet because my sleep hygiene needs work, but am hopeful that the combined weight loss and better habits will reverse the sleep apnea I was diagnosed with a couple of years ago. 

**Progress**


I'm trying to stick to 20g/carbs/day since moderation is generally tough for me so even though 50g might be ok, I don't want to give myself too much wiggle room. That said, the scale has slowly moved down a bit and I'm trying to plan for the next couple of months. I should be fully fat adapted between now and another week and I'm really hoping within the next month is when I really start to see the fat come off, so long as I don't overeat regularly. I have gotten some cravings (last night was particularly bad) but haven't caved, instead overeating other foods like cheese or bacon or pepperoni sticks. Starting this week I would like to really dial into the calorie counting and make this work for me.

**Strategy**

Originally I only planned to do keto for 3-4 months, ideally sticking to my calorie limits and getting lean before Winter so I can do a proper controlled bulk and focus more on weightlifting. Depending how the next couple of months go, I may transition back to a paleo-style whole food diet but we'll see. 

On my vacation next week I plan on sticking to my guns, only drinking whiskey/bourbon and sugar-free mixers if I drink at all, and being prepared with road snacks. We're staying in a cabin with a kitchen so I think overall it should be pretty easy to plan for. I want to start being more prepared and cooking more dishes instead of gravitating to the quick options. So far my diet has consisted largely of the staples: leafy greens and grilled zucchini, avocados, eggs (5-6/day), chicken, ground turkey, bacon, almonds, pepperoni sticks, and cheese. I recently found out Costco carries keto-friendly bagels so I picked some of those up and mixed in a scoop of strawberry whey protein into cream cheese for a nice spread.

**Hurdles**

Although I haven't outright cheated, I think I've done a little ""dirty keto"" without realizing it and am now wondering how important that part really is. A friend bought me some spicy pork rinds and I noticed the ingredients included maltodextrin and dextrose. Shit. I've also been drinking a lot of sugar-free sodas and Mio water flavorings, the former of which I've read you should be careful with and try not to consume them. I also drink a TON of black coffee, so no issues there.

My only other ""cheats"" have been a couple of bunless burgers in a pinch with no ketchup or sauces, just mustard and pickles.

So I guess my main question is, how do you fight cravings when you're already near your calorie limit for the day, and what do you do when you're just not really wanting the things you have in your fridge? I love eggs but when I already eat so many for meals, a hard boiled egg as a snack just doesn't cut it. As I mentioned, moderation can be tough for me and ""if you can have x but don't want it, you're just bored eating and are not hungry"" is hard to get past. Just looking for some advice, I realize a lot of it comes down to having an unhealthy relationship with food and re-framing can be helpful.

**Tips and Tricks**

My one big win was finding keto-friendly bagels and making a strawberry spread using whey protein to get my bread fix. It's more a texture thing more than anything, so if you're missing that, it's worth trying. I guess I don't really have much more advice than what's already been said, having something prepared and readily available really helps with not being tempted by other things.",keto,1

onglnm,Keto Recipe: Egg Wraps with Ham and Greens,"I  have a thing for pinwheel sandwiches; they’re just so pretty and such   perfect finger foods. What if you could skip the tortilla or traditional   wrap and use protein-loaded eggs instead? These wraps take the  trifecta  of breakfast foods — ham, eggs, and cheese — and turn them  into  portable bites that can work as breakfast or lunch.

When  I was developing this recipe, I really wanted to use just eggs in  the  wrappers, but they didn’t hold together in the pan and were  difficult  to flip. Adding some water and just a tiny bit of flour  (cornstarch if  you want to keep it gluten-free) to the eggs did the  trick. These egg  wrappers are sprinkled with Swiss cheese, then rolled  up with thinly  sliced ham and watercress, although you can substitute  your favorite  tender green like spinach or arugula instead.

Thanks!,"So I've been on Keto (25-40gm carb) for the past 6 months and recently adapted to IF (20/4), been making great progress towards my goal. But all of that discipline &amp; hard work is falling apart as I'm not able to stick with it, ever since I started my Mandatory Hotel Quarantine (I moved to the UK from a red list country for career reasons) 

Don't have an option of requesting a separate diet at the hotel, so I try my best to avoid sugary stuff, juices, fruits, carbs, and the 0% yogurts that they send to my room and only try to eat the proteins &amp; salads, which is not at all hitting my macros and sometimes tend to consume the bad stuff just because its there. 

I know this cannot be avoided, but do you think these 11 days will undo all my progress in my fat loss? I'll obviously get back to keto once I move to my place, but until then what should I do? I'm trying to stick with IF keeping it 18/6 and doing my best to at least avoid sugar, but I'm really hungry all day because of no fats.

ondnls,Anyone experience the multiple benefits of keto on low carb? Asking for long term planning.,"By low carb, I probably mean like less than 100 or even 50.  A pretty ""clean"" diet, though I hate the term, but I mean it as very little ""processed"" food, ie mostly ""whole"" foods, and avoiding the likely inflammatory culprits (depending on the person) like gluten, or, God forbid, eggs or dairy or peanuts, etc.

The benefits of keto I'm talking about is clear skin, not needing as much sleep or a nap, and maybe reduced anxiety or depression.  I've never experienced ""mental clarity"" so not an issue for me, but any additional data is fine.  I'm sure there are other benefits that I've forgotten because keto benefits are many.  Oh, endurance for activities that don't require huge bursts of energy.  Often, lack of hunger. Etc.

The primary motivation is: I HATE the thought of supplementing electrolytes for the rest of my life. Minor reasons are a wider variety in available foods,like real legumes, not black soy beans, fruits, some starchy veggies, etc.

I mean, if the cost benefit analysis says stay keto, I guess I gotta suck it up.  But first the cost benefit analysis has to be done.  I know many of the long time members and the mods are huge proponents of keto benefits, but the question here is, what gets lost in low carb, for those with experience. Maybe I need to cross post to low carb reddit also?  Surely there's one.

I dont doubt the recipe since I tried the same recipe with erythritol and sucralose seperately - They all taste great.

I have tried experimenting different brands of stevia - all gave me the more less similar results. Few brands were less bitter and slightly sweeter than other, but overall its same - the sweetness is disappearing while baking.

ond5tc,Should I count carbs/calories?,"Background: I’m returning to Keto after having two kids back to back. Was on ‘Keto’ for about ten years prior, kept an amazing weight, great energy, and much better mental energy (carbs make me foggy). I developed Hyperemesis (severe morning sickness during entirety of both pregnancies) and lived on any carbs/sugar drinks I could stomach. Kept these bad habits after my pregnancies, and my youngest is now two. 

Question: I never counted my calories or carbs in the past. I just cut out all classic carbs and sugar, but kept fruit and any veggies/dairy/meat that I wanted. This worked fantastically for me for years. It also allowed me a really nice eating lifestyle and I never felt restricted or like it took any work. 

I started this again 2 weeks ago. Lost 7lbs the first week, and only 2 ounces this week. I feel like I’m overthinking it, and should just wait a week before making any adjustments. I’m comfortable with 1-2lbs/week weight loss. But I’m older now, post baby, etc and wondering if my ‘old way’ is going to work this time?

onchs1,The Keto Diet: A Low-Carb Approach to Fat Loss," 

In recent years, low-carb diets have come to dominate fitness culture among those looking to lose weight. But there's low carb, and then there's keto. Low carb gives your body less of a certain [macronutrient](https://healthmozilla.com/) and brings your calorie count down. But the ketogenic diet goes so far as to encourage your body to burn fat as fuel![For More Articles Click Here.](https://healthmozilla.com/) 

When done right, the ketogenic diet can have major benefits beyond just weight loss. But if you know you're looking to use it to lose weight, you're in the vast majority. Here is exactly what you need to know to lose weight with keto.  

How Does Keto Weight Loss Work?

The idea behind the [keto](https://healthmozilla.com/) diet is to get your body into a state known as ""[ketosis](https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/ketogenic-dieting-frequently-asked-questions.html),"" where it stops burning carbohydrates as fuel and burns fat instead. Once you become ""fat-adapted,"" as it is called, your body begins to tap into its stored fat and actually burn that for fuel. It also begins to produce and burn tiny organic compounds known as ""ketones,"" which is where ketosis gets its name.

To achieve this fat-adapted state, you must take away [carbohydrates](https://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/calcarbs.htm) as a main ( [For More Articles Click Here](https://healthmozilla.com/) )fuel source, and replace them in your diet with [dietary fat](https://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/fats_calculator.htm). This means reducing your [carbohydrate intake](https://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/calcarbs.htm) to around 5-10 percent of total calories, or around 30-50 grams per day for most people.

How To Create Keto Weight-Loss Meals

To start building a keto weight-loss meal plan, divide these daily totals by however many meals you plan to eat each day. This will give you guidelines to follow for each meal. For example, 50 grams of carbs, 100 grams of protein, and 155 grams of fat spread out over 5 meals equals 10 grams of carbs, 20 grams of protein, and 31 grams of fat per meal.

Since the majority of your calories need to come from fat, you'll have to switch your thinking when it comes to meal planning and focus on choosing [high-fat, low-carb foods](https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/how-to-make-your-kitchen-keto-friendly.html) to build your meals around. Here is a list of foods to choose from:  

* Fatty nuts and seeds
* [Avocados](https://healthmozilla.com/)
* Whole eggs
* Full-fat cheese
* Fatty cuts of meat and 80/20 ground beef
* Chicken thighs
* Olive oil and coconut oil
* Butter
* Heavy cream
* Sour cream
* Cream cheese
* Fatty fish: salmon, mackerel, sardines, anchovies
* Bacon

You'll notice this list does not have any fruits and vegetables. That's because fruit is very high in carbohydrates, as are many starchy vegetables such as potatoes, corn, and beans.

Getting really close to changing the first number on the scale. Getting kind of excited. Probably would have happened on this weigh in day, but i'd have needed a laxative (i seem to go every 4-5 days, and it bothers me, but there's already enough fiber and hydration going on).   


Doing great. Struggling to get anywhere near the protein goals for the calculator, but am reliably over 100g a day now. Really a struggle since i'm NEVER hungry. Forgot to eat last week for well over 36 hours--just totally forgot. That's not great, but i guess it's not killing me, so i just have to get a little more routine.   


The new health quirk is that, I have been but on blood pressure meds about a week before i started keto on may 16th, and i had been put on a low dose because, while i was high at the DR in the chair (150/90), when a lay down, it plummets. So, they targeted the meds to get me under 140/90, and it worked, was around 135/85... when a laid down i was almost dead on 120/80. Nice. Nice and tuned in.   


NOW, however, i need off the meds. My unmedicated BP today (been off them since Wednesday because of dizziness and low BP), is around 125/70, and when I lay down, i'm hovering around 90/58, with a pulse around 45-55. Feels TERRIBLE, like there's a rock rolling around in my chest. DR has no clue what to do about this, or why i have this--orthostatic hypotension. No known reliable treatments of it, other than 'more salt'--which, my god, i already get SO MUCH salt i dont think i could. I'd have to start drinking salt water or something. The last day i was on the meds, my BP sitting was 120/70, and laying down was 78/40 (very nearly half of what it was in the drs office, sitting up, 2 months ago)--totally not cool.   


So, struggling with that, but loving the experience otherwise.   


Today i found yet another non-scale thing--i can reach the seat adjuster under the seat, by leaning forward. I used to have to twist sideways to get at that handle because my belly would stop me. Win!  


Good luck out there. If you've got any advice for me on the BP thing or more protein i'd like to hear it.",keto,1

-vitamin k(but It doesn't seem to account for K2(as 4 eggs has 70mcg of K2))
-folate(the gut makes folate naturally I thought)

-Vitamin B1 is something that seems low tho, only 80% of the RDA

I use butter to cook, no seed oils
I use keto aid to make sure my magnesium, potassium &amp; salt are sufficient, the formulation varies daily  depending on  food consumed

So basically, my questions are?
Is my diet to restricted?
Any need to worry about the highlighted vitamins?",keto,1
on2384,Increased vascularity,"Hi! I have been losing a ton of weight on keto since incorporating OMAD which is great, but I've been noticing that my arms and hands have become incredibly veiny since I dipped below 150 lbs.

I've looked around online and the only mention of this is from men who actually embrace the look. As a woman I really dislike this unfortunate side effect of keto.

SW: 232

I’m a 42 year old 6’3” male. The only negative side effects I’ve experienced are slightly lower energy, though LMNT electrolytes and CoQ10 have helped with that and thinning hair / hair loss.

omwble,60 mile bike ride,Hello Ketoers.  I’ve been cycling in and out of ketosis since February.  Started at 230 now down to 205 and feeling great!  Especially when I’m not eating carbs 🙂.  Before Covid and Ketoing I was marathon training and easily busting out 8 minute miles and long distances with a lot of glucose in my blood.  Now when I’m in ketosis I can do an easy 5 or 6 miles 3-5 times a week even while fasting but my speed never gets below 9 and 1/2 minute miles because I have no glucose to kick me into over drive.  I’m doing a 60 mile bike ride this Friday with two friends and I’m worried about slowing them down but also curious about trying this long ride in ketosis instead of carbo loading the night before.  Any keto endurance experienced people have insight into a long ride like this?  Will I bonk out?  Should I just carbo load?  Risks?  Thanks,keto,1

I would not call it a gambling problem in my case, but I do seem to spend more on donation raffles, scratch tickets and lotteries.  Whereas if my food is under control I will still donate or buy a ticket here and there but it will be the small donation that fits in my budget rather than the huge one that I can't really afford.  Sometimes my brain just wants to win and buy more tickets, so I spend stupidly. 

Also I would just run out and buy something that maybe I should budget better.

Over the years I found it certainly seems to correlate with controlling cravings.  Curious what you all have noticed and if there is any insight.  Is it chemical, or psychological?  I do know chemical is certainly plausible as there are medications out there that have a side effect of gambling addiction.

omuza8,Worsening body image?,"Hey, everyone!

I started keto exactly 10 weeks ago. I am a 20 years old female that is 164cm/ 5'3. My starting weight was 85,5kg/ 188lbs. As of today I am officially 72kg/ 158lbs. 

At first I was extremely excited about my weight loss. I was really unhappy about how I looked. I couldn't stand being in my own skin. Because of this I thought that the more weight I lose, the better I will feel about myself and my body. The effect is quite the opposite. 

I don't see any difference in the way my body looks and unfortunately I haven't taken any photos to track my progress, because taking such photos will most likely make me feel even worse. All I do is taking measurements, but even this doesn't quite help me in noticing the changed in my body.

It's as if all of a sudden I have become painfully aware about how I look, how much more weight I have to lose, etc. I feel bigger and unhappier than ever. I still have a lot of motivation to reach my goal weight (55kg/ 121lbs). I know that I will feel way better once I get there, but is this something that anyone on here has experienced? If so- what helped you feel better about yourselves and proud of your progress, even if it wasn't that significant or noticeable?",keto,1

omuhr9,Varying diets,"Hi guys! I am considering to vary my diets. My main diet would be a moderate low carb diet (under 100-150 carbs). I would throw in occasional fasting, a couple of keto days and a couple of high carb/Low fat days. So for example: 10 days Low Carb, 1 day fasting, 3 days keto, 3 days Low Carb, 2 days high carb/Low fat. But I would Not make an strict Plan, but rather listen to my body and adapt to the circumstances when life comes into the way. For example: I live vegan. Vegan and low carb/keto is often barely possible when eating out. I could imagine to switch to high carb on such occasions, but have an eye to my fat intake. Also, I think that eating all kind of foods could be the best way to provide your body with all it needs.

omt7yg,Chai almond milk = lifesaver,"Just thought I’d add a little trick I just started doing. First off:
-almond milk can be gross, find yourself a brand you like! Try splashing a small amount of heavy whipping cream in it if you really can’t stand the taste 
-most importantly, if you live in Texas, drop everything and go buy a half gallon of H‑E‑B ORGANICS unsweetened vanilla almond milk. This stuff is far superior to any almond milk I’ve had and it gets me through tough cravings with very little net carbs. 
-take a jar (or entire carton) of almond milk and throw 2 - 3 chai tea bags into the milk. Shake it a bit to get the teabags wet. You could also pre-wet them but the almond milk has a hard time diffusing into the grinds so you need to do something to help it. I tried warming it up and brewing but it came out too strong.

Let it sit shake every 2-4 hours or when convenient and let it sit for 12 hours at least. Then pour yourself a satisfying cold chai drink! No sweeteners or anything and this stuff is bomb. My next experiment will be adding gelatin and trying to make a milk pudding of sorts.",keto,1

omnnyn,Worse after ketones or cortisol problem?,"I don't know if this is the place to be posting. I've been experiencing dizzyness/lightheaded, which started out at full on vertigo. It's lessened as months have gone by, but my balance isn't great and I still haven't been driving. I've done Lower Carb in the past, but introduced more carbs (and higher protein) when I started working out last year. 2 months into working out regularly (maybe too much with my adrenal fatigue background) and the vertigo kicked in.

Anyways! Someone recommended I try Ketones so I was on them for about a week and intuitively I didn't feel like I should continue, they also taste so artificial and I felt worse. A metallic taste in my mouth and hungrier than usual, so I haven't had any since Thursday. That same day I pushed myself to do a light 15 minute workout. 

The next day, Friday afternoon, I was walking and it felt like all the energy had drained from my body, woozy, and I've felt like that ever since. Like, I've been laying around all weekend.

I am a 26F who started keto on February 18th.I started really motivated and with a super strict mindset but for the last two months I have found myself less motivated and frustated. Regarding numbers I have lost so far 4.5 kilos. 

I have a long story with diets and jojoing and I see myself going down that route again. I feel amazing when not eating carbs but for some reason carbs seem now more appetising than ever.

omjlbv,My journey with Keto diet and how I lost more than 30 kilograms in less than 3 months,"Hello, I just wanted to share my experience with a keto diet that I followed. So I am 24 years old. In recent years I started gaining a lot of weight, I was to 70 kilograms and then my weight reached 95 kilograms. A lot of changes happened to my body because of that. I got a second chin, I got huge face etc. So I started doing exercises and trying to limit the amount of calories I take but I didn't feel that it helped enough. I only lost 2 kilograms and it took me a lot of exercise and a lot of time and effort. I then searched google for the best way to lose weight in a short period of time and that's how I found the keto diet. I was 92 kilograms and I became 58 kilograms. I completely lost my second chin. My face became soo thin. People who know me where so concerned about me because my face and my body really changed. I wish I can show you the before and after photos of my face. It is insane how much I changed and I was really happy about that but there are some disadvantages which I will talk about at the end but in any case, it is a fascinating journey in my life. I will try to tell you exactly what I did and what food I ate. This might help you if you are trying to figure out the best way to lose weight.

So I started by not adding suger to coffee or tea. This helped me a lot because I became tolerant to these types of drinks and tastes without suger. Now, I can't even drink tea with suger because I don't find it appetizing. But this was the first step that I took. 

Then I did NOT eat bread. I completely avoided anything that is baked or made using flour like pasta etc. I also avoided all types of beans. I stopped eating rice. I started googling the amount of carbs in every food that I was about to eat. I only ate food that had zero carbs. 

For breakfast, the food that I ate was two hard boiled eggs. I added olive oil to them and a little bit of salt and that's it. That's was the only food that I ate in the morning. Eggs played a significant role in diet. In my mind, I was thinking that this is going to be a temporary life style until I lose enough weight so I didn't care if I lost my appetite to eggs I just kept going like this every morning. Oh and by the way, make sure that you sleep enough at night. Do NOT stay up all night. Sleep at least 7 hours. 

For lunch, I ate chicken, fish or meat. Do NOT eat fried chicken. I sometimes would add olive oil to chickens and a little bit of salt if I got bored of the taste. I also eat avocado with olive oil and salt. And sometimes, I just eat three hard boiled eggs. I don't like raw eggs because they have a sweet taste and that is not appetizing for me. 

For dinner, I did the same as breakfast. I ate 2 hard boiled eggs for dinner and that's it. My dinner was exactly like my breakfast. 

Since I am a Muslim, I had to fast everyday from 4:00 am until 6:30 pm for 30 days in the month of Ramadan. At it happened that during the time I was doing the keto diet (after one month of keto diet), the month of Ramadan came. Many people who have not tried fasting think that this is a hard thing to do but it is not. It is a little bit hard in the first day but in the second day it is sooo easy. And you don't have to not drink water. I mean, if you are not a Muslim, you don't need to follow all guidelines. You want to lose weight very quickly. So you just need to stop eating any food from 4:00 am until 6:30 pm. Before 4:00 am you can eat hard boiled eggs with olive oil and a little bit of salt. Salt makes the taste of eggs not boring and makes you feel a bit full. You can also eat chicken but not fried chicken. Don't eat a lot. Just until you feel that it is enough for you. Now, when you are fasting, you need to do cardio exercises. Running was my favorite thing. Jumping jacks was my second favorite thing. Run while listening to the music if you get bored but just keep running and running. Take a small nap after midday. This will give you a little bit of energy to make it until 6:30. Trust me, it will become so easy especially because you are already on keto which makes fasting very easy and the results will definitely be worth it. For the 6:30 meal, drink a lot of water before you eat and eat chicken, fish or meat. You can eat avocado or any food that has zero carbs in them. Just try to eat a little bit less than what makes you full. In other words, you will end your meal still a little bit hungry. Try to wait until 4:30 for your next meal. Drink water if you feel hungry or put some salt on your hand palm and just lick a little bit of it. This is helpful for not getting hunger. This will also make you thirsty and you will drink water. You will now ask, when do I sleep. Try to sleep at 9 pm or 8 pm. Wake up at 4:00 am or 4:30 am for your first meal before fasting.

Side effects: 

The most devastating side effect or disadvantage that you will definitely find during this keto and fasting diet is that you will not feel that you want to go to bathroom. You wouldn't feel that you want to defecate. You feel like there is nothing in there. It was a bit scary for me because one time I didn't defecate for 2 weeks and even after that I forced myself to defecate but still almost nothing feels to have been trapped inside me. I was like, ""OH NO, WHERE DOES THE FOOD THAT I AM EATING GO!"". This happens because you stopped eating fibers. Here is the solution, I used some herbs tea that makes you get diarrhea. The herbs don't cause stomach pain, they cause colon pain. They don't cause you to feel sick/wanting to throw up, no. They sell this herbs tea under a brand name in Egypt saying that it helps with weight lose. I don't know if I can mention the name of the product that I used in Egypt but these are the herbs it contained: 20% of Cichorium Intybus Herb, 30% Cassia Angustifolia Leaves, 50% Foeniculum Vulgare Fruits. I am not recommending this, I am just telling you how I solved that problem. You can figure out a different approach to solve this problem but you have to solved it. It is inevitable that you will get this problem. Maybe you will have to eat a little bit of fibers. Search for food that has fibers and no suger. 

Another disadvantage that you might face is your friends and family reaction. They might get scared of how much weight you are losing and try to stop you from losing weight. I actually stopped this keto fasting diet because of my family and my neighbors. I visited my father and he insisted that I eat rice with him. It was the first time for me to eat rice since two months and 7 days. Then my neighbor met me for the first time, he was shocked how much weight I lost. He insisted that I stop doing what I am doing and I was so embarrassed because he was speaking with me next to other people in a public place. I didn't want anyone to know that I am doing a diet to lose weight. I am very mad at him because I gave up with the keto diet afterwards. I just couldn't handle the criticism from my family, my friends and my neighbors. 

The other disadvantage is related to your mental health. You will start to become extremely cautious about your food. You will become very worried if accidentally ate a small amount of carbs. When my father insisted that I eat rice with him, I ate only one spoon of rice and when I got back home I was thinking all night about it wondering if I have broken the keto diet or not. It was very stressful and I was so angry and sad at the same time. I then realized that there is a problem with me. This is why I consider this to be a disadvantage. To solve this you just have to be so cool about it. After I stopped the keto diet I gradually started eating carbs and completely stopped eating any oil and my weight even lowered than it was. I was shocked and happy at the same time. I realized that it isn't a big deal to eat some carbs while in keto. So you also should be cool about it. Don't become a keto extremist like I was. 

Another side effect, is that you will have some weird skin issue where you find that your skin became loose in some areas where there used to be fats but it will be fixed by time. I don't know if old people will recover from loose skin though. 

And another side effect, is that you will lose some muscles. Because you can't do a lot of high-intensity interval training (hiit) because you feel tired of these type of exercises very fast. Especially during the fasting part. You will even experience some dizziness when you stand up, when you experience that do the stooping posture while standing until you feel better. It only lasts for 2 seconds.

The advantage is clear, I lost a lot of weight in a short period of time. Literally in less than 3 months I lost more than 30 kilograms (from 92 kilograms to 58 kilograms). And I think I could have lost more if I had more fats. You don't just lose weight, your face changes. I got a second chin when I became fat. I lost that chin completely. My jawline became sharp. As I said earlier, I wish I can show you some of my before and after photos but I am not sure if it is allowed here. Also, I don't want someone who knows me see my photos with this post. I prefer to stay anonymous on the internet. Back to the advantages, your confidence will increase and you will start to love yourself more and be proud of yourself more. I am also not sure about this, but I had a wart on one of my hand fingers and it disappeared, not sure if it is because of the keto diet but the wart has been there for 2 ½ years. 

It has been more than 2 months since I stopped the keto diet. I am trying to start a new one but my sleeping schedule is so unstable these days because I have exams and I am very stressed. And sleeping well is a key thing in keto diet in my opinion. 

I tried to give you guys as much details as I possible could. I wish you success in your keto diet. Maybe my post will push you to do it. You absolutely not need to follow anything of what I have done. This is just me trying to tell you my own idea of how you can lose your weight very fast using keto diet. You can have another idea and it might be way better than my idea. Feel free to ask if you have any question.",keto,1

omby66,just surpassed my original goal weight for a total of 86lbs lost,"I started keto back when my doctor gently asked if we could set up a physical when I was in his office for something emergency related. I knew it was about my weight but I had no idea how much I actually weighed and was not in touch with my body at all.

I got on the scale and braced myself for the number, reminding myself that the doctors scale always adds tons of weight (lol). Scale hit 242 and I was floored. I told my therapist how much I weighed, and he just flat out told me exactly what I needed to hear: “you need to lose 70lbs.”

I was hurt initially by his lack of coddling, but I knew I needed to change a lot of things. I wanted to be a desirable partner. I wanted to be a grown up, take care of my body like a grown up, and eat like a grown up, not like a kid whose parents left them home alone for the first time and just wants to raid the snack cabinet.

I was sick of feeling bloated, of the diarrhea, of the self loathing. 

Today I have lost 86 pounds and surpassed my original goal weight of 159, weighing in at 156, the lightest I have ever been as an adult. 

I never counted calories and I only recently started lifting 2x a week. I eat intuitively now and do low carb. Don’t give up! Even if you cheat, just get right back on. This was a huge lifestyle change and took me lots of time.

om101u,Ketosis Question from a noob,"Hi everyone,  I have a(nother) question....!

Firstly, I promise I tried to find the answer to this myself, but am just getting bamboozled 🥲🥲🥲🥲 and I know the folks on this sub are really generous with their knowledge, so....

I read in the FAQ that people have only so much glycogen stored in the liver, so when you stop consuming carbs you'll use what's stored there, and when that's used up you'll go into ketosis. If i'm reading it correctly it says most people will go into ketosis in 24hrs after stopping consuming carbs because that's the most your body can have stashed away.

But I read in all these other places that it can take a few days to reach ketosis,  some places even day 7-10 days! 

I think I'm sabotaging myself because I do really well for a few days (3 or 4) then I think, 'welp- not in ketosis yet, haven't lost any weight- it's clearly not working for me' say bugger it, and eat carbs.  I'm telling myself I'm not in ketosis because I don't have the weird smelling pee/breath, headaches, brain fog, etc., etc., that I read described as symptoms.  I do feel sleepy throughout the day, but that's just a standard state of affairs for me 🥱

I'm wondering if I'm just taking a while to reach ketosis and the caving in after a few days is because of carb cravings.... or am I possibly *already* in ketosis but just not recognising it because I'm expecting some kind of huge physical experience with symptoms galore?

I keep generally at, or below, 20g carbs for those few days when I'm doing well, I've been taking magnesium tablets daily and sea salt on my food.

I'd be really interested to hear other people's experiences of reaching ketosis and get some idea of the 24hrs v's a few days query.

but i got some 3-400 calories total out of 2500 maintenance, clearly ive got to burn fat to survive.

olpnds,Has anyone here successfully used Keto to deal with binge eating disorder?,"STATS: 5'7 Female SW:188.8/GW:130/CW:150

So my story is pretty common. Decided to lose weight and get 'fit' a few years ago, started off slow and steady and lost ~50 pounds, got impatient, cut calories too low for the last 10 and wound up rebounding and gaining those last 10 back. This happened another two times, and during this period I developed a binging problem. It's  been around for a couple of years, but it got worse after the start of Covid. It's made getting the weight off impossible. I'm not unhealthily overweight, but I'm uncomfortable.
Now I had heard several times that keto reduces cravings and appetite, but I had never really considered it (thought you were all nuts tbh).
Then a friend of mine who has epilepsy got told to go keto by her doctor, and she told me how she was never hungry anymore, felt great etc.
So I decided to give it a go. Went &lt;50g of carbs for the first week, binged on Saturday. Got back on the horse and went &lt;20g, binged on Saturday. This most recent week, I got to nine days &lt;20g and felt pretty good. My cravings were down, I had some pep in my step, I was getting over the adjustment period.
Unfortunately, I work in a bakery. There were some offcut bits of cookie dough and I nibbled. Then I nibbled some more. I got a sugar rush, and that led to three days of binging that I'm still trying to control. The sudden swing from sugar rush to feeling like absolute death was shocking. I didn't even eat that much the first day but my cravings came back with a vengeance.
From those successful nine days, I know that keto is something I want to pursue. Being off carbs made me feel good, and it was only a mindless action that knocked me off kilter. I know I can get back on track and that this has the potential to really work for me. If I can just get enough weeks under my belt without binging it'll get me off this carb rollercoaster. 
I'm just wondering if anyone in this sub went from having a bad relationship with food/binging, to successfully going keto and if so how they managed it/how its going for them.


TL/DR: Anyone here go from binging to keto, and if so how did you do it/how's it going?",keto,1

olo7us,Six months of keto helped me hit my goals mentally and physically. Progress pics.,"At the beginning of the year I decided to really work on myself to try to fight depression and turned to keto to help.  I've been overweight my whole life and had very little to no knowledge about nutrition or even how to cook.  Keto was simple enough that I just looked at every label and if total carbs was over 4 I'd put it back on the shelf.  That means I had an extremely restrictive diet until I was able to educate myself more.  As the weight came off I learned some basic recipes, the difference between total and net carbs, and was able to really enjoy my new lifestyle.  I'm proud to say I'm finally at my goal weight, a weight I literally never in my life thought I'd see on the scale again.  I feel so much better and promise if I, an ignorant, stubborn, and especially picky guy can do it, anyone can.

My friends and family mocked me the first month, then started asking for advice.  The best way to help others in my experience, is to live it myself and show them.  My brother is down 16 pounds in a month, my friend is down almost 70 in 4 months, and I'm thrilled to admit they both came to me first for advice after they saw my success.  I'm only posting this to help encourage others to do the same.  I feel better, my mental health is in a better place than it has been in years, and honestly nothing makes me more happy than to see others share in the same success.

It was not easy, but it was much easier than waking up every day and regretting who I was.

Love yourself.  Love yourself enough to put in the same effort you would for your most loved one, but on you instead.

olnc7q,Four Months Down - 75 Pounds Lost,"Hello, I've been doing keto for about three months now and I've lost a record amount of weight, according to my doctor.

I used to weigh 600 pounds (I'm not exaggerating) and had a whole host of health problems. I had to take two different medications for type 2 diabetes and had a high blood pressure medication. I couldn't stand for more than five minutes without being winded and walking up stairs or.. anywhere really, was impossible.

However, a friend of mine helped me get onto keto, helping me calm down my fears and worries about it. Keto actually felt natural for me after the first couple of weeks and I began to rapidly lose weight. I was even able to start going to the gym (recumbent elliptical is a miracle machine).

I've been going to my doctor once a month and we've been measuring my weight loss. Now, I weigh 522 pounds. I'm able to walk around without needing a break as often and my back is no longer in excruciating pain. I also only have to take one medicine for my type 2 diabetes and I no longer need my high blood pressure medication!

olmwgk,Keto and IF 2.5 months in,"Hey, my first post here. I'm coming up to my 3rd month with IF and Keto and this is my body results from doing that. I went from 96kg (211lbs) to 84kg (185lbs) roughly 80 days in.   
I also gained some muscle because I train in calisthenics (bodyweight excercises). 

In my opinion its great to mix in this style of training if you are overweight because even doing 1 pushup burns so many calories due to your weight. I would not recommend calisthenics to anyone who is obese though because even though it's a great way to train and tone up, it can be hard on your joints and cartilege due to so much weight being put on them.   


I jumped into 20/4 fasting from day one and never counted my calories. I would eat twice a day with my first meal having 5/6 whole eggs, 3 slices of bacon, lots of olive oil in frying pan and also adding some chorizo or other kind of fatty sausage to the omelette. Then for my last meal I would have either salmon/ fatty beef or some chicken and I would serve it with my own homemade garlic butter sauce. + lots of green veggies.

&amp;#x200B;

It was hard at the start but if you are experiencing some keto flu symptoms I would recommend chugging down some water with salt, also during your fast black coffee or water with squeezed lemon juice is good too. You want to keep giving your body necessary electrolytes as it switches over to using fat as the main fuel source. On my off days I would do a 36hr fast every week or so just because I didn't feel hungry anymore around 2 weeks in and could fast a little longer. Make sure to get a good nights sleep and keep yourself motivated as to why youre doing this.

Been doing low-carb for the past 3 weeks. Great results so far, losing weight and inflammation is way down. I have been heeding advice and not doing high intensity workouts. I have only been  lifting moderate weights and and walking a lot and still seeing great results.

My activity of choice is mountain biking, but I have had to stop to address my neck and back pain which seems to be much better now on my diet. I want to start riding again. The trails I require a lot of energy expenditure. I have raced as much as 110 km but a typical ride for me is 30 km  or so. It takes a lot of out the tank for sure. It is high elevation and chunky trails that require a lot of fast twitch muscle work. It is possible to burn through well over 1000-2000+ calories on a longer ride. 

I am wondering if eating carbs only on riding days is something that anyone has ever done. I am not fully fat-adapted yet (as I hear this can take months), but I want the cardiovascular benefits of mountain biking and the fun that comes along with it. The other option is the ride fueled by fats, but I know I would bonk much earlier.

olfrvl,"Sleep, magnesium, and carbs - about to give up","I have been doing keto for about 4 months and after the first two weeks, I started having sleep problems and have not been able to fix them since. Ironically I started keto because I had insomnia. It worked initially, the first two weeks of keto I slept perfectly. It turned out my original insomnia was due to going hypoglycemic at night (confirmed with a continuous glucose monitor). I have reactive hypoglycemia not diabetes. Keto also helped other hypoglycemia symptoms I had, such as needing to eat every two hours (or I’d get irritable, brain fog, anxiety, panic attacks etc ). So I really wanted to stick with it but then the new keto problems feel like they’re outweighing the benefits. 

I’m pretty sure my current sleep problems are related to electrolytes; I either wake up every hour and/or am in a weird half sleep. Today I woke up after about only five hours of barely sleeping. 
My guess is that this started after I got magnesium deficient in the first month of trying keto. I read the FAQ probably 20 times and yes I was tracking. But still I didnt supplement properly because small amounts of Magnesium citrate were giving me diarrhea. And according to the magnesium dose instructions that meant I was having too much. 4 doctors later, I started getting magnesium IVs and taking at least 400mg of magnesium glycinate a day, and I noticed big improvements but the sleep never went back to normal. I’m scheduled for more IVs, as I don’t believe it’s fully restored yet (based on other symptoms too). 
Last week I had some friends visit and I ended up eating more carbs, one day I had a donut, next day a couple dumplings, next day half a bagel, next day half a naan bread, and after a couple days of that my sleep was perfect. They left and I went back to keto and the old problems returned immediately. I don’t know if I can take the bad sleep anymore, but I’m also worried about my reactive hypoglycemia symptoms coming back. 
Should I hold off on keto until my magnesium is restored? Or just give up and go low carb instead of keto. Would be so grateful to hear if anyone has had a similar experience and what they did to fix the problem.",keto,1

Giant tubs of ice cream, the virus, lack of exercise, depression, self hate and negative internal dialogue all contributed. Ouch, that looks awful in print. This was the one place where I could be myself, without judgment or negative ideas plaguing me. Slowly, my mind began to change, and my body with it. The support and positive feedback from so many people on  r/keto really made me realize that I am acceptable, that I can love myself however I am, and that any medical issues I have are manageable with diet and exercise, as the phrase goes. My internal understanding of me is so much better. Honestly, I only managed perfect keto for 3 ish weeks. The test of the time, I've spent learning about my body's ability to lose weight and how my food choices affect that. I've also learned that any type of excessive starch ( potatoes,  noodles, bread, etc) will cause bloating, inflammation, and pain. I've settled on very low carb, almost keto most days when it is reasonable, with periods of fasting occasionally. If anyone has any questions, I'd be happy to answer them in the comments.

I’m a 25 year old guy. 

I gained 80 pounds in 5 years after graduating high school. 90% of the time in those 5 years I was actively “trying” to lose weight. I went from 180 in 2014 to 267 in July 2019.

I just never stuck to anything.

It was a familiar routine. I’d start a new plan and then when the scale stopped moving I’d soon fall off.

So I got rid of the scale and went all in on tracking.

I decided to go “all in” on losing weight on October 22, 2020.

I haven’t weighed myself since. 

I’ve maniacally tracked every calorie, reevaluated my TDEE regularly, and track my predicted/theoretical weight in a spreadsheet based on my deficit.

According to that I’m down 45 pounds and at my lowest weight since 2014. I’m down 65 pounds total (I previously lost 20 pounds in two years before starting this journey).

I started Keto a month ago and it’s accelerated my results even more.

I’ve lost about 7 inches off my waist depending on the day and the weather. It sounds crazy but I can easily go up two or three inches on my waist in the head and humidity. 

On those hot and humid days I have to admit I get really tempted to weigh myself. But then the weather cools off and my shorts start falling off again 😂

ol0a4v,"1 year keto-versary, lost 146 pounds","A year ago today I decided to start doing something about the diabetes I'd had for nearly a decade. I had taken medication, but otherwise changed none of my habits...because who wants to live a life without freshly baked baguette or homemade Mac &amp; cheese?! But 2020 was a horrible year &amp; I wanted something good to come out of it. So, I told myself I'd try keto for 1 month. It took less than 2 weeks for the cravings to stop. And the weight was falling off of me. 

I hadn't purposefully tried to lose weight since I was in my early 20s &amp; had an ED. I found the fat positive &amp; HAES communities &amp; learned to love my body. And I did love my body in a way I never had when I was a size 4/6. I believed being fat could also be healthy. I stayed in denial for years because I was young &amp; my health was fine. Until it wasn't. And still I ignored it. 

Eating keto has made me feel in control of my food choices for the first time in my life &amp; I'm not tempted to eat any of my previously favorite foods...nor do I have cravings that lead me to make unhealthy decisions. Carbs are addictive...at least they were for me. It was easy enough to make these dietary changes during the pandemic when we weren't going out to eat or sharing meals with friends. I was worried when things started opening up again that I would revert back to my old habits. I was thrilled to find out that I can still enjoy meals out at my favorite restaurants &amp; sharing food with friends is still possible. 

In addition to losing 146 pounds in the past year, I've also got my diabetes under control &amp; am off all medications. My last A1C was 4.3. I've been lifting weights at the gym 3x a week for the past 5 months &amp; I'm getting stronger. I feel better than I have in decades &amp; have so much more energy. 

I wanted to thank this community for the motivation I've received over the past year &amp; let you know...it's possible. I started this when I was 50, so never think it's too late to change &amp; become a better version of you.

And I wasn't looking forward to trying on my swimsuit today in anticipation of our family vacation at the end of the month. But I needed to know if I had to go out and buy a new, bigger swimsuit than the one I'd dragged up from the basement, the one I hadn't tried on in years. 

The last time I wore the suit, I was 10 pounds lighter than I am now and had originally planned to have those 10 pounds gone by now, but I've been stalling hard every few weeks for the past few months. And the stalls last from a week to a month. I'm currently stuck at 152. Yet my macros and calories are on point and I'm lifting weights and walking lots of steps, so I'm being patient. But I wasn't expecting miracles. 

Only, the swimsuit fit. Not only did it fit, but it looks great. Seriously great. I'm shocked. I kept looking at different angles to try to find something I could use to prove to myself it didn't look \*that\* good. But, seriously, if this was someone else, I'd think, ""I'd like to look like that."" I'm just shocked and amazed and so happy. I don't know how this new body snuck up on me, but it did!

My husband happened to walk in the room to tell me something and he stopped dead and said, ""Looking good!"" And he's telling the truth! For the first time in a decade or so, I'm excited to wear a swimsuit on vacation.

## So What Made The Difference?

#### What was that ONE mistake?

Well, most people on a new diet **have no plan.**

They learn what to eat and not to eat. They try new recipes…

***But, they DO NOT have a daily plan to carry them through the critical first month.***

Without a keto weight loss diet plan, it’s very easy to fall for peer pressure… to be unprepared… and to make unconditional decisions.

So, to be clear, that ONE mistake is **having no plan in place.**

**But we have that plan. And our plan has guided over 416,387 people to success!**

oks4wr,Keto slowly but surely changing my life.,"  Hi, I'm overweight (112.6kgs, 188cm), and I've been on keto for about 4 months now. For the first two months, I wasn't able to shed off a single kilogram, due to snacking on peanut butter that has loads of calories. 

   Since about month and a half, I've started hitting gym and changed my diet to include mostly vegetables, zero (7) calorie noodles, eggs, beacon, keto bread, alfredo sauce, and other decent keto choices that make me stay under calorie limit, but keep me full.

   My MiFit application shows I've shed 3.6kgs in that time, despite doing strength training on gym every 2-3 days.

   I am extremely happy because of this, and since I've never had much muscle, the gains have been pretty big too. I can finally feel something in my hand and I'm being obnoxious to my girlfriend, flexing to show her my gains every couple of days. It's nice to feel something in my arm for a change, and she doesn't mind it too much :D.

   I'm honestly feeling amazing, even though I don't see any visible to the eye difference in the mirror yet. Granted I have not taken before/after photos, and my girlfriend did note to me once that my posture changed a lot.

   The biggest bonus of keto for me personally, is the lack of hunger. I am unable to satiate my hunger on traditional diet. On the other hand, on keto I can't possibly fill all my caloric needs, especially because of the close-to-zero calorie noodles that are mostly fiber and keep me full for a long time.

   My quality of life has improved, my back pain has gone away, my hand joint pain after car accident has been unnoticeable, which is also pretty surprising to me. This is nothing short of a miracle if you ask me.

   My plan is to keep being on keto for possibly the rest of my life, although I feel like I will need to broaden my diet a little bit with more carbs in some time, due to currently limiting myself very much and the food getting quite repetitive.",keto,1

From days 9-13 I have gone from 166.4 lbs to 167.1 lbs.

I've tried to explain everything I've done since beginning keto, and tho I am very greatful to have lost 4 pounds in 13 days, I am worried about my sudden reversal in progress. What can I do?",keto,1

okk3cj,What about LDL cholesterol?,"I’ve been in ketosis for two months and am about due for my yearly physical. I am very active and not overweight, just like before keto.

I like being in ketosis because it makes it easier to keep that “pudge” off my gut that I’d always have when eating carbs. Here’s my question:

Animal fat and sodium can raise LDL cholesterol, so if my physical comes back high in those levels, and my doctor tells me I should stop keto as a result, what should I say?

Doing some research, it seems that LDL can build up plaque in the arteries, leading to either a stroke, heart attack, or angina. Is there any reason why you wouldn’t be susceptible to those
conditions while in ketosis?",keto,1
okjzo2,i’m just so happy,"just thought i’d say i’m so glad for what keto is doing for my life. 

haven’t hit any new milestones or anything crazy, but keto has given me the boost i’ve needed to take care of myself again. keto is curing my depression, literally. this gets a little dark, but since starting and losing weight, i legitimately feel a reason to wake up again. i’ve started really getting into self-care in all aspects. 

improvement in self grooming, teaching myself about and taking more supplements, sleeping full nights, tracking my water consumption, willingly exercise, the list can go on. i feel more focused on self goals than i’ve ever felt. covid cancelled some plans on a big move and in return presented one of the worst depressions/binges/weight gains of my life, but i’ve been able to turn that around and even have now lost more weight than i’ve gained over this period. i’m so thankful for keto, those who discovered and shared it, and this community for being so inspiring.

Holy smokes, I’m so excited.",keto,1
okjjmt,IF / Keto and this past week.,"I'm not a doctor, nor am I giving advice. I just want to share what's happened with me the past week. 

I learned about green smoothies. I'd had some in the past, but not on keto. So I made some with beet leaves, parsley and kale, with a little lemon juice. My blender was not tops, so I ended up with super-nutrient water and a ton of pulp to chew. I drank/ate about 15 ounces the first time. 

My energy skyrocketed. I was so excited, I did it again the next day (and ordered a decent blender.)  My stomach was not very happy with me, but I still had better energy than normal. 

Same thing on Day 3 . Then on Day four, I did not feel well and I emerged from a bath absolutely covered in itchy red hives. 

I took an antihistamine right away. 

Next morning, the hives were also invading my throat and lungs (this can be dangerous, but since I was not struggling to breathe, I didn't go to the doctor,.)

After a bowel movement, I had good relief from the internal hives. But I was still suffering on my skin. 

On Monday morning, I woke up with swelling in my face, especially my lower lip. Then yesterday, it was my upper lip. I swear, I looked like a character on The Simpsons! I took an antihistamine each morning until today. 

Another reason I didn't go to the doc is the expense.  Yes, I have insurance, but I can't afford the deductible. I know that a doc may help treat the symptoms, but we may never know exactly what caused the hives in the first place. I've never been a sensitive skin/body person. 

The only new food for me in the smoothies was beet leaves. I'd never had those before. 

But I had also never had such an intense dose of nutrients like this before, either. 

Since I felt so much better after a bowel movement, I figured my best hope is to get the stuff out of my body. I decided to fast until I am sure the hives are gone. 

I am now about 25 hours into the fast and my face is normal and I only have a tiny hint of hives remaining on the back of my neck. 

Of course, in all this time, I have been doing research online. I've read about keto rash (my hives don't fit the description of that.) And I have read about detox symptoms...

I know everyone is different. Have you had any experience like mine? I would love to hear from you. I need to feel understood. Thanks for reading - I hope this was not TMI.",keto,1

okfz1c,Questions about integrating IF with keto and exercises.,"I just started 16:8 roughly 1month ago, it went well, I even get to exercise 1-2hrs three to four times a week.  Now I wanted to incorporate keto, however, I find it very difficult to adjust to my new diet. I am aiming for 40-50g of carbs, my typical carb intake is 70-80g.

I don't eat bread, pasta, legumes, beans, or rice but I love wraps, fruits - esp apples, and veggies - cucumbers, cabbage, celery and even indulge myself with milk. 

A typical whole wheat wrap has 22g, cucumber has 11g, apple has 17g, quinoa (1cup) \~25g...

How do you all adjust to the keto diet while making sure it's a balanced diet? How long does it take you to get acclimated? Did you convert to the keto version of all your favorite foods? e.g. milk --&gt; almond milk, wraps ---&gt; low carb wraps..etc

I am not a vegetarian nor much of a meat eater.  On days that I hit my carb goals, I would still be hungry. At which point, I would go for hard boiled eggs, roasted chicken, pork chops to hit my protein goals. But when I am just eating these proteins, it almost feels like I am doing it for the sake of meeting my daily intakes.

Whereas with the keto diet, I rediscover the pleasure of cooking. I think the constraints of the keto diet make my time in the kitchen much more fun and motivating ... I love finding tips to get the result I want, testing recipes, finding an original way to cook for the thousandth time of the cauliflower ...

And not only does it give me the pleasure of cooking, which I no longer had when I ate garbage, but above all it prevents me from snacking. Because I don't buy anything prepared, just vegetables, nuts, flour, cheese etc ... but there is nothing in my fridge that I can take out to eat straight away, except green beans.

Either way, I know snacking is my weakness so I don't buy anything that I know I'm going to eat at full speed.

It helps a lot.

*Having multiple flavors of Sparkling Ice and other no calorie drinks on hand -- feels like a treat!
*Not attempting to replicate carb-based foods -- ribeye steak and salad than is way more delicious and satisfying than fake lasagna
*Two meals a day in an 8 hour window
*Both meals are based on the same concept: meal one is protein plus low carb veg; meal 2 is a low carb wrap. This is not boring -- I doubt I have every had the same meal twice.
*Stocking the freezer with every kind of protein that I like -- I take two portions out to defrost every night
*Pre-portioning the proteins before freezing -- my macros allow 4 ounces at most but could eat more, so this prevents me from eating a whole steak
*Staying away from my favorite high calorie foods even when they're keto! E.g., I love blue cheese dressing and macadamia nuts but can't have them in in the house. 
*Allowing myself to go off keto in restaurants when there's a special occasion -- this is controversial but if I had the mindset that I was never going be allowed to eat a french fry again I'd probably binge. When I want to eat fries I just tell myself I can have them but not today.

My willpower has been strong and I haven't had huge urges to get back on sugar after a few rough days in the beginning. However, there has been a couple of times when I had 2-3 light beers probably totaling 15 g of carbs total or so. 

Is this bad? I still end the day satiated, in a caloric deficit and generally lighter the next day. I am not a big drinker. Even before keto I would drink a few beers maybe 1-3x a month. I find 3 light beers seems to get me a nice buzz and I can still hang with friends and not have to hide out in my house.

ok6d85,High Trig/HDL ratio in my cholesterol after 5+ years on keto,"Hey guys. Please be kind :) I've been doing keto for over 5 years now with no breaks. I recently switched GPs and after seeing my bloodwork, my new doctor immediately prescribed statins. My old doctor also did but I never filled the prescription. I know from my time on keto that statins are a no - they do more harm than good and don't fix the problems. But I also am realizing that my ""bad"" cholesterol is just not going down. My dad's side of the family has a history of high cholesterol, and two of his brothers have been on statins since their early 30s. I should also mention that my cholesterol was high even before keto.

Here are my current cholesterol stats with what the doctor said the levels should be.

* CHOLESTEROL - 270 - Bad, should be &lt;200

* TRIGLYCERIDES - 142 - Good, should be &lt;150

* HDL CHOLESTEROL - 47 - Good, should be &gt;39

* CHOLESTEROL / HDL RATIO - 5.74 Bad, should be 0.00-4.44

* NON-HDL CHOLESTEROL - 223 - Bad, should be &lt;130

* LDL CHOLESTEROL (CALCULATION) - 195 - Bad, should be &lt;130

I know a lot of people here use the Cholesterol Code website. I entered my numbers into their report thing and got confusing readings. They said my trigs are *high*, and that my LDL shows signs of me being a standard hyper responder. However, they describe a standard hyper responder as someone going on a low carb diet then having their cholesterol raise significantly. As I already said, I had high cholesterol before I started. 

I also know from the FAQs that ""the only important factor is how many LDL particles (LDL-P) you have."" But,

&gt; That being said, a good predictor for LDL particle is the Triglycerides to HDL ratio:

&gt; Trig/HDL ratio in mg/dl: 1 is perfect, below 2 is good, above 3 means significant disease, above 5 means you will explode any moment.

**My trig/HDL ratio is 3.02, which means ""significant disease.""** Ironically, those are the only two that I tested ""normal"" for with my doctor.

So. I have a ketone blood meter. It's pretty accurate. I tested it a few days ago and it was .5 and that seems low. Tested it today and it's .3 so now I'm like wtf. I found a neat little calculator that uses sliders to see a ratio that will make sure you get into higher ketosis with the right macros. I tried it and my protein is too high, calories are too low, and not enough fat. 
Don't get me wrong, I've lost 27lbs so far. And still losing! I think it could be faster. I like the science aspect of this whole thing and don't mind doing this.

ojtcul,Goal day! 40lbs down," 37M 5'6 SW: 203 CW: 160

When I made the decision earlier this year to focus on a keto diet and take control of my health I set a goal of 175 by the end of July. I was hopeful at the time but had no idea how successful and impactful this would be. After about 3 months I hit that 175 goal, which I couldn't believe at the time. I wanted to keep going and really change my lifestyle. 

 Today I hit a revised goal of 160, a little more than 40lbs lost. I still don't quite accept how far i've come. I now wear medium shirts (previously XL or L), size 33 pants are big (previous 36/38) and overall feel great. People can see the different and more importantly I feel the difference. My constant acid reflux has gone away and my overall health is much improve. I got to play and enjoy softball again this summer which I haven't the past 2 years. 

Most importantly I think is proving that I can stick with something, enjoy it and succeed. Reading success stories on here has certainly help inspire me so I wanted to share mine.

ojs256,The story of failing and getting back on track," I feel like I need to share my experience with others, as I wish someone would have shared the same with me many years ago.

My weight loss journey started over 20 years ago, and never stopped since, culminating with a WLS (a gastric sleeve) in 2017 (SW 360, CW 215, GW&lt;200). After the WLS I've lost about 70 lbs and hit the plateau which lasted for a few months. I tried breaking it with intensive gym, calories counting, but no real impact. As a result, I've lost motivation, and over the next 2 years gained about 30 labs back, mainly due to late night’s snacks, sometimes full of sugar. That was a failure and caused a huge frustration. Having a gastric sleeve - one of the best weight-loss tools - I turned into a ""regain statistics”, and no longer an individual with life and willpower. Although still having a restricting ""pouch"" stomach, in just about 30-40 minutes after having a meal I was ready to eat again.

During the covid quarantine, by November 2020, I hit 290 lbs. My frustration have turned into anger. I’ve spent some time researching various diets and practices. And, as of today, I'm back on track, lost over 70 lbs since Nov. And here are my 3 key pillars, which brought me back:

**1. Low carb diet.** After researching multiple trendy diets, Keto seemed to be the most promising one. But I didn't like the idea of consuming mainly fats, and avoid vegetables. I'm an old-fashioned guy. So I adjusted the KETO idea by adding a decent daily portion of green veggies (zucchinis, asparagus, green pepper, kale - those which have nearly no sugars, yet lots of fiber). My fats are limited to avocados, nuts (Brazil and Macadamia), a bit of cheese, lots of eggs and fatty fish (like salmon). As a result, I’m in constant ketosis, while still having a decent amount of fibers and healthy protein. My nutrients are around 50-60% of fats, 25-30% of Proteins and 10-15% of carbs.

**2. Intermittent fasting,** mostly 18:6, but slowly shifting to OMAD. I’m now confident that low carbs diet and IF are made for each other. Being in ketosis one feel no hunger, which makes fasting a simpler task. Also once a week I do a 42 hours fast by skipping one full day - usually a day before “a scale check morning”.

**3. CICO** (calories in, calories out) is the 3rd pillar. Keeping everything tracked is not just a good habit, but also makes me feel I control the entire process better. My daily intake is around 1,400-1,600 calories, which creates a substantial weekly calories deficit.

A few more hints from my experience:

* Being aged 40+ gym can't be the only solution. Being active is important for health in general, but unless a professional athlete, 1 hour walk every day (outdoors or a treadmill) is good enough.
* Being properly hydrated is a must, healthy weight loss won't work without it.
* Supplements!!! Lots of those! Keto+IF+CICO is a sort of a restriction, causing a substantial nutritional gap. Multivitamins, husk fiber, omega-3, collagen, cumin, ox bile, vitamin D, electrolytes etc etc. My recent blood work returned nearly perfect results - no deficiencies, and the lowest sugar level I ever had in my life.
* Scale is great, but regular DEXA scans and RMR tests keep me informed about my progress. If you have those services available to you in your area, you won't regret.

I do hope someone will find it helpful. I decided to post under a Keto forum, as I think it’s the key. But IF and CICO are also instrumental. I wish I knew that years ago, before my WLS. But better late than never :)",keto,1

Before I get into my keto journey, I need to rewind to a year ago. I fell into a really deep depression to the point where I couldn’t eat. My meals were either baby food or a cheese quesadilla from Taco Bell because ironically that’s all I could stomach. I ended up losing close to 40 pounds by the time I snapped myself out of it. As a result, it became very difficult for me to eat full meals once my appetite came back. 

I was happy to lose 40 pounds but obviously not the way it happened. I decided to start keto at the beginning of June in an attempt to lose another 30-40. I’ve lost 12 pounds so far and I’ve been plateaued at 187 for over two weeks now. I’ve read the FAQs and the wiki several times and I know I’m not getting enough protein. 

Here’s my problem. I feel like my body is reverting back to that “starvation” phase I was in a year ago. I’m pretty much OMAD (unintentionally) at this point but I have such a hard time eating enough. I’m not hungry through the day and then I sit down and I’m only able to stomach 700ish calories before I can’t force anything else down.

I do an hour at the gym in the morning, cardio + weights. Then I do HIIT training in the afternoon. I don’t eat back the calories I burn, and I stay to my carb totals and exceed protein by 20g or so while keeping my fat at about 75g (19g less than my recommended) with ease because of the foods I tend to make. I also supplement my electrolytes and get the recommended targets 95% of the time.
The mornings seem to be the time I’m insatiable. I get home and drink my protein shake and then wait an hour or so before cooking up some eggs, avocados, etc, and by the end of it I’m usually at 400 or so calories. Which would be great but after that for the next 3-4 hours all I want to do is eat something else.

I was 130kg and depressed and just wanted to be happy. I was already down from 142kg which I slowly lost over 2 years by cutting down portion sizes and drinking less beer, but for the most part my diet and drinking habits were still shocking. At this stage I had hit a wall at 130kg and couldn't motivate myself anymore. I'm 6ft and quite broad so I didn't hold that weight like an obese person. Regardless, I decided to try keto and to my amazement this weight has seemingly fallen off. Granted, it has taken hard work and a lot of will power over the last 5 weeks but I have quit drinking all together, quit carbs and started doing a 40 minute cardio workout after work. I absolutely love the energy associated with this lifestyle - it inspires and almost euphoric mindset. I'm still upset about the breakup, but I'm improving myself everyday at this stage and I'm so excited for what is yet to com - I am still 21-22. For anyone lacking motivation, TRUST THE PROCESS.

I started keto last July woth my partner, doing 20g carbs a day. We did beautifully and loved it, lost 40 pounds(ish). I felt amazing for about six months. 

But over the last 6 months I've been very on and off, mainly because I'm absolutely sick of everything I've been eating, and we had a really nice variet to begin with. I've also been too depressed to really neal prep lately, so I've been relying on quick and easy keto stuff for work, which I'm also sick of. 

I've gotten to the point where I can't stay on the diet for more than a couple weeks, I've gained back 30 pounds, and I constantly feel an overwhelming urge to make myself throw up any time I get off the diet. I'm not going to for obvious reasons. I just feel like absolute garbage constantly and like I'll never be able to really get back on keto like I was before, which scares me because this has been the only lifestyle change that's had lasting effects and many other health benefits.

It just feels like I'm gonna stay disgusting like this forever, and there's no hope for me. Does anyone who has gone through this have any advice for me? If I reach the weight I started (which I'm getting really close to) at I'm gonna completely break and go back to my old eating habits entirely, as I'm a severe stress eater.

Probably.,"My health shifted when my mindset shifted and I realized that the oreos or chips ahoy or whatever else on the shelf for $2.99 was not the barrier between me and happiness.  If you are new to keto and you get these cravings for packaged food-like drugs I feel like it's important to ask yourself why you want them so much.  Will you be happy if you have them?  You used to have them all the time, were you happy then?  They are built by robots in a factory with no love using the cheapest ingredients sold by the lowest bidder.

And if you really sat down and ate them slowly, savoring them and tasting them instead of shoving them serially into your mouth two at a time you'd realize they really aren't even that good.

Look deep into your heart when you crave a food that contributed to your poor health.  The KFC, the cheeseburgers and fries, the coca cola, the oreos and twinkies.  Is everything in your life so well sorted out that this is what is missing and that $3 and a 15 minute trip to the store will bring you eternal bliss?  If this really is the case, go buy it.

I attributed the pain to large amounts of time sitting at work and I even went in to the doctor and spent thousands of dollars in appointments and MRI's. I was at the point of considering injections of steroid in my neck to control the pain. The doctors really found nothing wrong with my spine and neck but I did notice the pain crept on when my blood sugars started dropping from after a meal.  I kind of realized at this point my diet had gotten really bad and needed to do something. 

A coworker of mine had lost a bunch of weight on the keto diet so I researched it and have been on a pretty strict low-carb diet for two weeks. While I am not totally fat-adapted, I am able to get through the day without intense sugar cravings now which before, had totally controlled me. 

The best part I have noticed is my back and neck pain are 95% better and each day I seem to feel more and more normal. I started noticing improvement only two days in. For the first time in several months, I forgot about my deliberating back pain over the weekend. 

My diet had been junk and I am assuming that was contributing to pain and arthritis-like symptoms. I really wish more doctors would at least suggest approaches to diets during their consultations. I realize I left myself get out of control with my eating, but I am so thankful I am feeling more normal each day. Thankful to be in this situation of feeling better without pharmaceuticals.

They are, by definition, a signal or message embedded into another medium that is intended to transcend the boundaries of human perception. Although these messages are not easily recognized by the conscious mind in all situations, they can have a significant impact on the subconscious mind. They can also influence later thoughts, behavior, actions, beliefs, and value systems.

Felt okey after we passed the first Mountain. 
It was was around 10km to the next Mountain, started to loose my apetite. But still got some food in.
We kept on walking, got to the last Mountain. No apetite what so ever. 
Was struggling, walked around 300-400 meters. Then break and so on.

Now we walked 17 km and had to walk 17km back.

Walked around 7km then i started to puke. At this time i have consumed around 4-5 liter water.

Now, I am 22 lbs lighter and have never felt better.","I’m someone like a lot of people here who has struggled with weight pretty much my entire life. I’ve tried multiple weight loss regimens/diets, some worked and some didn’t and I did lose some weight but I wasn’t able to keep it off. In the past 5 or 6 years I really fell into a depression and gained an insane amount of weight. I just didn’t care about myself anymore because I figured that I was only going to live to a certain age and there was no point in trying to lose weight. My self-confidence was at an all time low, I didn’t look in mirrors, I avoided going out with friends, and was just constantly anxious.

But a little over a month ago, I don’t know what but something clicked for me. I’ve always known what keto is and after doing some research, I was just like “screw it!”, I decided to try it on a whim.  If it didn’t work for me then oh well, but if it did, I promised myself that I would stick to it. And flash forward 5 weeks, I’ve lost 22.4 lbs. I don’t think I have been this light since 2018, who really knows lol because I always avoided the scale and going to the doctor in the past few years. But yeah, seeing this amount of weight come off really makes me proud of myself. I know I still have a long journey ahead of me, but I have never felt this motivated in my life. 

I feel like there’s actually hope for me for once. I no longer idealize dying at a young age because of my lifestyle change. And a lot of it is due to this community!

I’m in my 3rd week of keto and I just went for a run this morning. I’m super unfit and I usually run for pretty short only but today was just horrible. I couldn’t even run 200m and I started to feel so dizzy, my vision blurred and my hearing got faint so I immediately sat down and it took a few minutes to recover.

I’m now home and I find myself feeling dizzy again every time I stand up from my couch and my vision turns blurry. It happens for the initial few seconds after standing up and then it’s okay, but it’ll happen again after I stand up. 

I think it’ll go away after a few weeks, right? It was pretty scary and I have plans for the upcoming week that can’t be postponed - I just hope I won’t feel fainty even though I’m simply out walking instead of exercising",keto,1

oim5e8,"I’ve hit a wall on my weight loss, a small rant, and I have questions.","Let me start with saying eggs, cheese, and bacon for the win, In the beginning I began every day with them and I’ve lost 81 pounds so far. Lately I’d stopped eating breakfast, for the life of me I don’t know why, but anyway, I noticed that I wasn’t losing weight. I haven’t gained any, but nothing has come off the past 4 to 5 weeks. 

This is the rant part: clearly losing 81 pounds shows so now that everything is opening back up and I’m physically going into work once a week people see me and 1) don’t recognize me right off the bat and 2) tell me I shouldn’t lose anymore weight!  What the hell! I’m not below 199 yet so clearly I have more weight to lose.

I went and did a recheck on my macros and while I was eating over my target calories, 150-200 over, I was never anywhere close to my carbs limit. Most days I only ate 10 carbs. During this time I’ve started HRT to keep me and everyone close to me safe and I wondered if that could have an effect on my weight. 

Also, this really should have been first, but I discovered Rebel ice cream. I’m not the type to eat a tiny amount so I eat the whole damn thing. At first I would only eat one pint a week, but that didn’t last long, and now I’m eating one almost every day but I know now this is straight from the devil and I have to stop. Pray for me!

It took 5 weeks for the weight to start dropping again. Once it did, there was a very satisfying drop of a few kilos over a fortnight, and then all of a sudden it was stabile again, and stayed there for about a month. Then it wooshed away again!

ohvlsg,Thank you!,"I have spent my life fighting my genetics and my lifestyle. I really got my diet under control when I was in my twenties and became cognisant of what I ate. I had hit 230 lbs. I’m 6’ 4” so was never very large but too much for my comfort, muscle mass and body structure. I lost weight but it was a hard journey of calories and cardio (yeah, that old story)….

In my 30’s and 40’s I did plenty of exercise, ate only fresh,  non-processed food (it helped I was living in Spain which has some of the highest quality and cheapest food in the developed world! I was lucky to have a big garden and “Huerta” (fruit and veg garden) and grew everything organically.)

However, it was a huge effort not to gain weight. In Spain I lived a very social life (it was a beach town on the Mediterranean coast after all!) and I gained weight, dieted, gained weight. I never got to the peak weight of my early 20’s but it was always a battle, even though my diet was extremely healthy (aside from the booze).

I started weight training (lifting) around 4 years ago to see if that would help. I wasn’t interested really in beefing up, just seeing if it would help give me tone and help me not gain weight. It kind of worked but not really. I still had decent body fat (guessing around 25%).

Then I discovered r/keto and had also done some decent research via Tim Ferriss and many of his interviewees like D’Agostino. Also the guy training me for weights was a competitive bodybuilder and he explained that most competitors uses a keto diet to crash body fat ahead of competitions. I figured if people who competed found it the most effect I’ve way to lose weight, it is probably worth trying.

This community gave me the encouragement (as a lurker) and the knowledge, science and tips for success. The single most important being “keep calm and keto on”. I learned so much from all the patient answers to newbie questions.

Like most people doing keto for the first time, I lost weight REALLY fast! I didn’t quite know what I was doing but r/keto kept me on track.

But then I just continued with the keto life, sometimes breaking it for a few weeks vacation, a special dinner, etc. But overall I found the simplicity comforting and gave me structure. I’m not a structure guy and love to rebel but the idea that carbs were a no (meaning &lt;20gms), protein was fixed too so the only dial was amount of calories from fat. Easy!

I’m three and a half years living keto. I occasionally cheat when I want to, but I do drink wine. I try to avoid too much red, especially high alcohol (has higher sugar content) but still drink it once or twice a week ( 2 to 3 glasses - I lived in Spain for 10 years! You can’t take red wine from me…). I also drink white but my saviour is champagne and Spanish cava, which is cheap, widely available and good and is super low carb. The odd vodka soda, gin and diet tonic, rum and Diet Coke too or neat spirits on the rocks. Careful however as booze and keto knocks you flat!

The point being, my keto isn’t perfect but it works. I’m 53 years old and instead of gaining few pounds every few months, I lose a few pounds. I’m down to 176 pounds and am within 15lbs of fat loss to be what I always dreamed of, and in top health. For exercise I currently do yoga 3 times per weeks and am pretty active.

My only issue has been when I screw up my electrolytes and feel like shit and get a migraine or I have too little magnesium and get the night cramps.

I feel like I’ve found the secret for me. Keto suits me. I don’t feel deprived. I am not dieting. I’m not hungry. I just feel like I have the right structure to eat with pleasure and have no negative side effects! It’s a miracle.

And owe my personal journey to you all in r/keto. I learned that is not some weird diet fad but a scientifically proven lifestyle choice that worked for me..

Thanks ! I hope my story helps you in your story…

I also make sure every meal during the weekday is 100% a ration of 6g net carbs, 28g protein, 66g fat. I'm okay if I hit plus or minus 2% for each macro.

Blood sugars are often over 100 when fasting and can go up to 145 but never above.

If I just eat proteins for a day or eat low gi food as while wheat etc I feel 10x better and all this sickness tends to disappear. It's like my body is allergic to carbs.

He used to bike 20-30 miles maybe at least 4 days a week and was keto + beer sometimes so he could still party with our large friend group. He used to be really skinny fit not a ton of muscle but in really good shape... 

Over 2020 because of covid he was doing school from home and not in his biking area anymore. We also started dating October of 2019 so that was our first fun dating year of eating at restaurants and vacationing, etc. He gained a lot of weight, dont really know how much (maybe 20-30lbs???), and since then he has grown out of most of his tshirts and dress clothes which he used to wear 90% of the time cause he's a fancy dude... 

I feel really bad for him and want to help so much, we live with his parents and sister so there is often non-keto food around to tempt him, and also he just loves it and has the hardest time resisting non keto food even after 3-6 or so days of back on keto. I've offered to cook for us, look up recipies, encourage lovingly to go back, support him, ask about biking, hiking, and walking, going back to planet fitness together, do a makeshift 75 days hard with him, etc. but nothing has worked. When he gets himself ""motivated"" he just won't eat until dinner time and then make something easy for himself to eat that doesn't require any planning or prep. 

Yesterday he didn't eat at all and then we ran out of time to eat before going downtown with friends... well 2am came around, I was DD, and everyone wanted Del Taco, and I thought he just starved himself all day to start keto and should keep on it. We drove with 2 of our very close best friends so it wasn't like I was teasing him or embarrassing him, but I said he could only get keto options there because I want him to succeed and be happy from now on! One friend even offered to get keto food with him, but when it was his turn to order he just didn't get anything... :(

Anyways when we are alone he jokes around a lot and says stuff like ""you think I'm disgusting,"" constantly and I tell him I love him still, he's not disgusting, etc, and I just want it to end! I want to help him get back on track and enjoy wearing his clothes again and feeling sexy, but I just feel like giving up and not having a say or trying to help him anymore. I never post on reddit but I need other guys' advice from your point of view, thanks so much in advance.

ohkxop,Inaccurate info on recipes,"Just finished week two of keto. Lost 11 lbs first week and realize it was water weight. This second week I gained 2 lbs. 

I have been watching my macros and recording in CarbManager. And have been under my carbs every single day for two weeks. Averaging 18 net carbs per day. 

So in trying to figure out what I did wrong, I found out that this keto chili recipe I made didn't have the net carbs of 3 as stated in the recipe. After entering the ingredients into Verywellfit, the actual net carbs was close to 10. Having 2 serving of this each day means I was actually getting 20 net carbs vs the 6 I was thinking. 

The ONLY way you could get this recipe close to a net of 3 was to subtract the net sugars, which was 5. These sugars came from the vegetables used in the recipe. My question is, do many of these recipes subtract this sugar total? I was under the impression that only sugar alcohol, to some extent, was deducted.",keto,1

ohdd55,My depression story and why I quit keto + Looking for accountability partners for keto part 2,"I have decided to restart keto after discontinuing the lifestyle about two years ago. I’d like to talk about what led to me quitting this lifestyle that worked so well for me in the first place, which does include me discussing the decline of my mental well-being, as well as my struggles with body dysmorphia, binge eating disorder, and the death of two of my close relatives.

Here is a timeline of the stressful events that occurred in 2019: In April 2019, the same day I had been terminated from a job I really enjoyed as an act of retaliation from management because I had requested a workplace accommodation that would have excused some shifts I had to miss for medical needs. In May 2019, I was assaulted by a cop during a traffic stop because he did not believe me when I stated I wasn’t on any illegal substance. In July 2019, my favorite uncle passed away unexpectedly from a heart attack. In August 2019, my grandma passed away a few weeks after an MRI detected multiple cancerous brain tumors. I was able to spend her last weeks with her, but nothing could have softened the impact of her death for me. I was very close to my grandma, and I miss her more than I can put into words.

Somewhere among the chaos, I stopped eating keto and quit monitoring my food intake. I went back to using food as an unhealthy coping mechanism for stress, anxiety, and grief. I have gained about 110 pounds, and on some days, I can barely look at myself in a mirror. I am extremely embarrassed to have lost 80 pounds with keto from 2017 to mid-2019, just to gain it all back—and even more.

The past two years have included a few unsuccessful attempts to restart a keto lifestyle, but the major depressive episode I had entered in 2019 was getting in the way. My mental illness was no longer controlled with the two antidepressants I was taking, and I also came to the realization that my destructive eating habits fit the diagnosis criteria for binge eating disorder.

This mental health crisis had now begun to cross over and deteriorate my physical health, since my unhealthy relationship with food also led to a diagnosis of prediabetes in January 2021.

But things are looking up. In March 2021, my mental health finally started improving when I started rTMS therapy for depression. The debilitating depressive episode that I entered in 2019 was finally coming to a close, and I feel like I found mental clarity and inner peace with treatment. It was every day for a good 3 months, and I just finished in May. I think I’m finally ready to commit to taking better care of my body with keto.

So, with all my thoughts all written out, I hope I can finally gain a sense of accountability for myself. If anyone knows a good resource for finding accountability partners, or if anyone reading this is interested, my DMs are open. If you read this far, thank you so much!",keto,1

So it turns out over the year since my last physical, my LDL (bad cholesterol) has jumped 40 points to 190 mg/dL and my doctor is recommending I cut out the meat and fatty foods or else he wants to put me on meds for high cholesterol.

I mean, truly, this is a game changer. 

The biggest celebration: I had my HRA screening call for work today. Last year, that call was painful. I hit 3 of 5 risk markers for metabolic syndrome/pre-diabetes and was high risk. I was in the risk category for every.single.metric. Today, they told me I'd completely reversed it. I'm not high risk anymore! I also **improved** in every.single.metric. the person on the call told me she was proud of me. Of me! It felt amazing. I still have work to do, but I know I can do it and will be a keto life longer.

AND I HAVE YOU TO THANK! I want to say thank you to all of you. I tried keto a few years ago and liked it a lot, but got some really fundamental pieces wrong. Had too much fat. Didn't focus on electrolytes. Etc etc. This group gave me the information to do it right and the daily stories to keep me going. I've learned so much about my body and how it works because of each of you. You are an amazing community and I can't say thank you enough. I want to share this victory with you and ask that you take it as your victory, as well, bc I couldn't have done this without you all. :)",keto,1
oha1mg,Keto again - In a year of immense happiness and deep sorrow," 

I and my wife were suggested one meal a day keto late last year by our doctor. This was to better our chances to conceive. We had just lost a pregnancy and my wife was recovering. I started keto January 1st and my wife was already doing for a couple of months. However, she joined with me for OMAD plan.

Interestingly, she fell pregnant the same month. We both were over the moon. I stayed on Keto for an other month. But then, my pregnant wife went off keto to eat the 'so called' nutritious foods in fruits, vegetables and then cup cakes, cookies and you know the drill. I fell of my keto wagon as well, as we have already had our mission accomplished. The best 5 months of our life. We made so many plans for our future and were confident acting on them. We have never been as happy until she miscarried into her 5th month. Everything came crashing down. We had waited so long to successfully conceive and only to be denied by the rarest of conditions, two times in 9 months.

I started to binge drink. She soaked in tears, depression, bouts of anger directed at no one. We ate crap and together with alcohol, I put on like 20lbs. It is more hard on her obviously with the physical pain and trauma. I have a new found respect for women for all that they go thru.

I just started keto again a week ago and have started to hit the gym. I am running two miles a day on the treadmill and lifting a little bit. My body is way too bad after a month of alcohol abuse. I am sober for two to three weeks now. I am determined to get off the 20lbs and start trying again. Hopefully this time, if she gets pregnant again, she will carry it to term.

 The scale shows 4lbs less than last week. Water weight probably. I am going to do it this time. I am 185lbs for a 5'8 male and want to go low 160's. I am going to bacon and run my way to it.",keto,1

So, I've been sticking pretty close to eating 70% fat, 10% or less of carbs and 20% of protein. I've been keeping to a calorie deficit pretty effortlessly, going from at least 2400 calories a day to about 1500.

The only real carbs I seem to eat come from either Monster Ultra Zero energy drinks, and Mission carb balance wraps. The particular monster drink I listed only has Erythitol as a sweetener (which I have read does not count as carbs for doing keto), and fiber in the mission wraps (which I understand also does not count).

Most of my meals consist of a carb balance wrap, some sour creme or cream cheese, shredded cheese, maybe avocado, and some bacon or breakfast sausages.

oh9rtw,Hey. Guys. Is there ANY chance fasting + keto can cause heart attack + lung infection symptoms?," I'll keep it quick because I don't want to waste people's time on what might be outlandish BS:

Prior  to fasting + keto, I was just a normal 21 year old male eating a normal  ""balanced"" diet with no diagnosed health conditions and a normal  weight.

On day one of fasting, I  developed a chest pain and shortness of breath. The next day, I went to  the hospital and they told me after testing me that the only potential  indicator was of a virus or infection. Fast forward twelve days of the  same symptoms persisting - it hurts to breathe in and I really can't  exert myself without making the symptoms worse - tonight after a walk to  the shops, the pain started intensifying in the evening in the left  side of my chest, and then spread up to my neck and back.

So,  I called the paramedics; they did tests on my heart and chest, and  again told me that everything is fine and that they believe it has  nothing to do with my heart.

Then,  one of them told me that I should stop my diet (currently keto OMAD)  and go back to my old ""normal"" diet to see if it gets rid of my chest  pain and shortness of breath.

Is  there ANY chance a change from a normal carb diet to a keto diet,  bearing in mind that these symptoms started 24 hours after my last  ""normal"" meal, could cause such acute, scary symptoms? (And I haven't  had any other symptoms! No headaches, no lack of energy, nothing!)",keto,1

pr3zju,A brief overview why cholesterol (LDL) is implicated in the etiology of heart disease," 

# Here's why I believe that cholesterol is implicated in the etiology of heart disease

📷

I often see articles or post by people who are skeptic that dietary cholesterol and serum cholesterol play an important role in the initiation and progression of coronary artery diseases. Here’s why I believe that dietary cholesterol and high serum cholesterol do increase cardiovascular risk, hoping we can have a healthy discussion about this issue.

First, I want to address two popular claims.

First claim which comes in many variations

&gt;Cholesterol is essential for health ergo you need it

This claim actually implies that somehow it would be possible to have no cholesterol, and that this is what some people are recommending. The irony here is that these same people are always repeating that the body makes all the cholesterol it needs (when saying that dietary cholesterol has no impact on serum cholesterol). So why would it matter to eat zero cholesterol?

It also implies, as done by many people, that since it is essential to life, it is not possible to have too much of it and you should not care about hypercholesterolemia.

I hope anyone here can see the absurdity of that claim. No one is claiming that cholesterol is not essential to life. What is being claimed is that supra-physiological level of cholesterol is a problem, in the same way that supra-physiological level of glucose is problematic, and in the same way as supra-physiological level of iron is problematic, both of which are also essential to life.

That kind of binary, black and white thinking should be a big red flag right of the start.

Another important claim to get out of the way

&gt;Low-cholesterol actually *increases* mortality

There is actually very little evidences for that claim, and many evidences showing the contrary, and this claim is usually done using very weak ecological data, such as this [one](http://perfecthealthdiet.com/2011/06/blood-lipids-and-infectious-disease-part-i/).

Just take a look at this graph and it’s obvious what’s going on : people that die the most of CHD on this graph are all from poor countries, with little access to good medical care, whereas people that die less from CHD are all from rich countries with top medical care such as Japan, Canada, Switzerland, Danemark… etc etc. Don’t let that kind of weak data confuse you.

First, there is a well known reverse-causation when it comes to low-cholesterol and mortality, ie, many diseases actually cause cholesterol to go down, which could make it seems like low-cholesterol is linked to mortality. Here are references for this [1](http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/92/9/2396), [2](http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/92/9/2365).

There is [little evidences](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17697899) that lowering LDL-c increases non-CHD related mortality.

Also, there are evidences that people with low-cholesterol level throughout life actually have increased lifespan. [1](http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/192897), [2](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0026049597900044)

Now, let’s get down to the matter : why do I believe that cholesterol is implicated in the initiation and progression of artery diseases?

There are multiple lines of evidences for this, going back as far as the early 1900’s.

**Line of evidence #1 : Cholesterol feeding in animal model (including herbivores, omnivores and carnivores) consistently lead to narrowing of the arteries.**

It all started when [one researcher](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1764970/) fed rabbit a diet rich in cholesterol and realized they were quickly developing atheroma.

One critic that cholesterol-skeptic like to make is that this can be discarded since rabbit are herbivorous and are not well adapted to a high-cholesterol diet. Well, since then, these same results have been replicated in herbivores, omnivores, carnivores, and many primates species. [1](http://atvb.ahajournals.org/content/26/2/242.full), [2](http://scialert.net/abstract/?doi=ijps.2004.671.684), [3](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0021915073900257), [4](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0021915074900409),[5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9389784),[6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1903425/) Cholesterol feeding then become, in animal research the *sine qua non*, which mean essential condition, to induce atherosclerosis. This is all very well accepted within the scientific community, there are no doubt about this relation and the efficacy of high-cholesterol feeding to induce atherosclerosis. In comparison, sucrose has never been shown experimentally to be able to induce atherosclerosis in the absence of cholesterol in the diet.

And this point is actually of high importance because dietary cholesterol is probably more strongly linked to cardiovascular risk than serum cholesterol. In [animal model](http://circres.ahajournals.org/content/circresaha/34/4/447.full.pdf), it was possible to induce atherosclerosis with a low-supplemented cholesterol diet, even if the serum cholesterol did not raise much.

As the authors note

&gt;This study was focused on changes in the arterial intima of a nonhuman primate after administration of dietary cholesterol at levels far below those used conventionally to induce experimental atherosclerosis. The intimal changes observed were correspondingly much smaller. The regimen for group 1 was originally designed to demonstrate a null point of the effect of dietary cholesterol on the arterial intima. However, such a point was not found; no threshold for dietary cholesterol was established with respect to a putatively adverse effect on arteries.

Meaning that any amount of cholesterol above zero was increasing plaque buildups.

This point is important to consider and remember.

**Line of evidence #2 : People with genetic polymorphisms that have genetically low-cholesterol level have a decreased risk of cardiovascular disease**

Mendelian randomized studies are studies that looked at the effect of certain gene polymorphisms with a known effect on a given outcome. It makes it possible to avoid classic confounding factor problems in epidemiological studies.

There are many genes that are linked to low-cholesterol level. Many mendelian studies have found that people with such genes suffer far less from CHD. [1](http://www.onlinejacc.org/content/60/25/2631), [2](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa054013#t=abstract), [3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25770315).

&gt;All 9 polymorphisms were associated with a highly consistent reduction in the risk of CHD per unit lower LDL-C, with no evidence of heterogeneity of effect (I2 = 0.0%). In a meta-analysis combining nonoverlapping data from 312,321 participants, naturally random allocation to long-term exposure to lower LDL-C was associated with a 54.5% (95% confidence interval: 48.8% to 59.5%) reduction in the risk of CHD for each mmol/l (38.7 mg/dl) lower LDL-C. This represents a 3-fold greater reduction in the risk of CHD per unit lower LDL-C than that observed during treatment with a statin started later in life (p = 8.43 × 10−19). [1](http://www.onlinejacc.org/content/60/25/2631)

**Line of evidence #3 : Drugs and other lifestyle intervention that reduce cholesterol consistently reduce cardiovascular incidences and mortality**

Statins and other drugs that decrease cholesterol by differing mechanisms consistently show decreased CHD incidences and mortality [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2645847/), [2](http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2556125). Some people have critic statins by saying that they have pleiotropic effects, which is true. But there are some other means of reducing LDL-cholesterol that have no known pleiotropic effect and that still results in reduced CHD risk.

LDL-apheresis is the process of filtrating the LDL-c molecule of the blood of patient. It’s mainly used in people with FH (see below). This process, which usually result in a large decrease in LDL-c level, also result in a large decrease in CHD risk for these individuals [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9874053).

&gt;LDL apheresis significantly reduced LDL cholesterol levels **from 7.42+/-1.73 to 3.13+/-0.80 mmol/L (58%)** compared with group taking drug therapy, from 6.03+/-1.32 to 4.32+/-1.53 mmol/L (28%). With Kaplan-Meier analyses of the coronary events including nonfatal myocardial infarction, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, coronary artery bypass grafting, and death from CHD, **the rate of total coronary events was 72% lower in the LDL-apheresis group** (10%) than in drug therapy group (36%) (p=0.0088).

**Line of evidence #4: People with a genetic defect that suffer from very high cholesterol level (familial hypercholesterolemia) die very young of heart diseases. Decreasing cholesterol level in these individual greatly increase their survival odds.**

Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a genetic defect that results in very high LDL-cholesterol in the blood.

Unfortunately for these people, their risk of suffering from a cardiovascular event is greatly increased [1](https://academic.oup.com/aje/article/160/5/421/74662/Familial-Hypercholesterolemia-and-Coronary-Heart).

&gt;The risk of fatal or nonfatal coronary heart disease by age 60 years was 52 percent for male and 31.8 percent for female relatives with FH compared with 12.7 percent and 9.1 percent for relatives without FH. [1](https://academic.oup.com/aje/article/160/5/421/74662/Familial-Hypercholesterolemia-and-Coronary-Heart)

**Line of evidence #5: Population studies consistently show that life-time exposure to high cholesterol level is associated with increased cardiovascular risk and mortality.**

Pretty self-explanatory. Epidemiological and population studies found a strong link between high serum cholesterol and CHD. [1](http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/389185)

So basically we have strong evidences that :

* Cholesterol feeding in animal (across many different species) causes atherosclerosis
* People with genetically low cholesterol level that die less of coronary heart disease
* People with genetically high cholesterol level that die very young of heart disease
* Drug and other lifestyle intervention that reduce cholesterol level decrease CHD risk
* Population studies that consistently show that people with high cholesterol level develop and suffer more from coronary artery diseases.

What other explanation than cholesterol could explain all those observations? What could be another connecting factors else than cholesterol for all of this?

Now, nobody here is saying that cholesterol is the *only* risk factors. Anything that increases injuries to the arterial wall and causes inflammation (high blood pressure, smoking, hyperglycemia, saturated fatty acid, infectious agent) will participate in the initiation and progression of the diseases, but it takes cholesterol and lipoproteins for the atherosclerosis plaque to form.

I hope this can lead to a healthy discussion about the issue, and that it can helps people understand why it matter to keep their cholesterol level within the normal range, which should be [under 150 mg/dl.](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0735109704007168)

The link between high cholesterol and coronary artery diseases is regarded by many as one of the most solid link in modern biomedical science.

If we were looking at the [Bradford-Hill criteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradford_Hill_criteria) for establishing a causation, the high-cholesterol-CHD link is consistent will all of the 9 criteria, which makes it very likely that the causation is real.

To quote Jeremiah Stamler (one of the leading researchers on cardiovascular diseases of the 20th century) in his [criticism](http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/91/3/497.full) (highly recommended) of the [2010 meta-analysis regarding SFAs and CHD](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20071648)

&gt;*In fact, the decisive dietary modification for experimental atherogenesis, the sine qua non or materia peccans (Anitschkow's term), is cholesterol ingestion. This has been the prerequisite since the 1908–1912 breakthrough by Anitschkow et al (a centennial anniversary meriting celebration and discussion) in thousands of experiments in mammalian and avian species—herbivorous, carnivorous, and omnivorous—including nonhuman primates.* ***To neglect this fact in a review about humans is to imply that the Darwinian foundation of biomedical research is invalid and/or that there is a body of substantial contrary evidence in humans. Neither is the case***

[Here's](https://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/comments/53wxd2/need_help_raising_my_hdl_levels/d7xmh34?st=itfqeujx&amp;sh=031cb01d) another. Notice how that person claim to not be an expert - just a layman that read a lot. Well, no offense to anyone, but I think this is part of the problem. People read a few blogs/books and they vastly overestimate their knowledge.

Dietary cholesterol DO raise serum cholesterol and given the [strong link between serum cholesterol and cardiovascular diseases](https://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/comments/5qumxo/heres_why_i_believe_that_cholesterol_is/?st=iynnm5hc&amp;sh=2b73bbbe), it's quite dangerous to me having uneducated people running around telling other people not to worry about eating food rich on cholesterol and the impact that that could have on their cholesterol level.

**Where does the confusion come from?**

Here's an excellent review to get started. [Dietary cholesterol and egg yolks: Not for patients at risk of vascular disease](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2989358/)

&gt;The effects of dietary cholesterol on serum cholesterol are, in part, dependent on the diet and the characteristics of the individual consuming the cholesterol. Dietary cholesterol has a much greater effect on people consuming a low-cholesterol diet, with a threshold effect as shown by Connor et al (31)

And from [Effects of dietary cholesterol on serum cholesterol: a meta-analysis and review.](http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/55/6/1060.abstract)

&gt;When modest amounts of cholesterol are added to the daily diet, the major predictor of change in serum cholesterol is baseline dietary cholesterol. Thus, when one or two eggs are added to a diet that is typical for the average American (containing ı400 mg/d), little change would be expected. \[...\] These observations suggest that persons who are accustomed to a very-low cholesterol diet may be more sensitive to dietary changes.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Summary**  
&gt;  
&gt;Serum cholesterol concentration is clearly increased by added dietary cholesterol but the magnitude of predicted change is modulated by baseline dietary cholesterol. The greatest response is expected when baseline dietary cholesterol is near zero, while little, ifany, measurable change would be expected once baseline dietary cholesterol was &gt; 400-500 mg/d. People desiring maximal reduction ofserum cholesterol by dietary means may have to reduce their dietary cholesterol to minimal levels (&lt; 100-150 mg/d) to observe modest serum cholesterol reductions while persons eating a diet relatively rich in cholesterol would be expected to experience little change in serum cholesterol after adding even large amounts of cholesterol to their diet.

So, the impact of dietary cholesterol is in part dependent on your baseline serum cholesterol level and on your baseline dietary cholesterol intake.

This is where the confusion come from. Given that the average american cholesterol level is [192mg/dl](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/cholesterol.htm) and the average daily intake is 300-400mg, most people are not likely to see a difference on their cholesterol level by adding more eggs, hence they come to the conclusion that eggs have no impact. But as you will see shortly, this is false when you start with a low (read normal) baseline intake and serum level.

**Evidences from meta-analysis**

I've cited one already. Here are others

[Dietary cholesterol from eggs increases the ratio of total cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in humans: a meta-analysis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11333841)

&gt;RESULTS: The addition of 100 mg dietary cholesterol/d increased the ratio of total to HDL cholesterol by 0.020 units (95% CI: 0.010, 0.030), total cholesterol concentrations by 0.056 mmol/L (2.2 mg/dL) (95% CI: 0.046, 0.065 mmol/L; 1.8, 2.5 mg/dL), and HDL-cholesterol concentrations by 0.008 mmol/L (0.3 mg/dL) (95% CI: 0.005, 0.010 mmol/L; 0.2, 0.4 mg/dL).

[Dietary cholesterol and cardiovascular disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26109578)

&gt;Dietary cholesterol statistically significantly increased both serum total cholesterol (17 trials; net change: 11.2 mg/dL; 95% CI: 6.4, 15.9) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (14 trials; net change: 6.7 mg/dL; 95% CI: 1.7, 11.7 mg/dL). Increases in LDL cholesterol were no longer statistically significant when intervention doses exceeded 900 mg/d. Dietary cholesterol also statistically significantly increased serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (13 trials; net change: 3.2 mg/dL; 95% CI: 0.9, 9.7 mg/dL) and the LDL to high-density lipoprotein ratio (5 trials; net change: 0.2; 95% CI: 0.0, 0.3).

[Plasma lipid and lipoprotein responses to dietary fat and cholesterol: a meta-analysis.](http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/65/6/1747)

&gt;Predictions indicated that compliance with current dietary recommendations (30% of energy from fat, &lt; 10% from saturated fat, and &lt; 300 mg cholesterol/d) will reduce plasma total and low-density-lipoprotein-cholesterol concentrations by approximately 5% compared with amounts associated with the average American diet.

[Dietary lipids and blood cholesterol: quantitative meta-analysis of metabolic ward studies.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9006469)

&gt;Avoiding 200 mg/day dietary cholesterol further decreased blood total cholesterol by 0.13 (0.02) mmol/l and low density lipoprotein cholesterol by 0.10 (0.02) mmol/l.

**Evidences from eggs feeding studies**

[Effect of egg yolk feeding on the concentration and composition of serum lipoproteins in man](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3986015)

&gt;Upon egg yolk feeding the mean level of serum total cholesterol rose by 13%; the bulk of this rise was due to LDL cholesterol, which increased by 21%. VLDL and IDL cholesterol decreased by 19 and 11%, and serum total triglycerides by 17%.

[Cholesterol feeding increases low density lipoprotein synthesis.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6308052)

&gt;Egg supplementation raised high density and low density lipoprotein cholesterol levels by 18 and 40%, respectively.

[A dose-response study of the effects of dietary cholesterol on fasting and postprandial lipid and lipoprotein metabolism in healthy young men.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8148356)

&gt;Fasting plasma total cholesterol concentrations increased by 1.47 mg/dL (0.038 mmol/L) for every 100 mg dietary cholesterol added to the diet (P &lt; .001). Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol increased in parallel. Responsiveness varied but appeared to be normally distributed. Fasting plasma apoprotein B concentrations increased approximately 10% between the 0- and 4-egg diets and were correlated with changes in total and LDL cholesterol concentrations.

[The serum lipids in men receiving high cholesterol and cholesterol-free diets](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC290802/)

&gt;The addition of dietary cholesterol in the form of egg yolk caused a significant increase in the concentration of cholesterol and phospholipid in the serum. The serum cholesterol and phospholipid decreased greatly when egg yolk cholesterol was removed from the diet.

[Ingestion of egg raises plasma low density lipoproteins in free-living subjects](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6142348)

&gt;Mean plasma low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol was 12% higher (p = 0.005) and mean plasma apolipoprotein B was 9% higher (p = 0.007) when eggs were being consumed than during the eggless period.

[Effects of dietary cholesterol and fatty acids on plasma lipoproteins.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC370171/)

&gt;Addition of 750 mg cholesterol to the diet with P/S = 0.25-0.4 raised LDL cholesterol by 16 +/- 14 mg/dl to 115% of basal diet values (n = 11, P less than 0.01); 1,500 mg increased LDL cholesterol by 25 +/- 19 mg/dl to 125% (n = 9, P less than 0.01).

Well, I could go on, as there are many other studies like that, but I think it's quite obvious by now.

Dietary cholesterol DO raise serum cholesterol level (mostly LDL and to a lesser extent apo-B), given that a) baseline serum level is low enough and b) baseline intake is low.

If anyone have high-cholesterol, lowering dietary cholesterol intake to &lt;200mg will certainly have a positive impact on his number. So please people. Telling someone who's asking about the effect of eggs on his cholesterol number to not care about it is doing a big disservice to the individual.

The biggest loss of crop diversity came in the decades that followed the second world war when, in an attempt to save millions from starvation, crop scientists found ways to produce grains such as rice and wheat on a phenomenal scale. To grow the extra food the world desperately needed, thousands of traditional varieties were replaced by a small number of new super-productive ones. The strategy that ensured this – more agrochemicals, more irrigation, plus new genetics – came to be known as the “green revolution”.

By example here in Norway, nutritional information is usually labeled on food items as ""per 100g"", and contents include kj, kcal, proteins, sugars, saturated fat, unsaturated fat, karbohydrates, salt, etcetra. 

By intuition I would assume high in protein, low in kcal and karbohydrates would indicate a higher level of 'health', while high in kj/kcal, saturated fats and low in protein would typically label a food as 'more unhealthy'.

So, is there anything of the nutritional information that can be used in this regard?

I've seen an interview with a man, James Nestor I think is his name, who said that our physiology is changing because of the invention and popularization of processed foods, which makes the jaw muscles more atrophied than before. He says our mouths are actually getting smaller because of the softer foods, and that's why we have to take out wisdom teeth, and also why our hard palates are shrinking, which causes breathing problems like sleep apnea.  
  
I don't have this problem. Dentists say I can keep all my wisdom teeth, and I don't have sleep apnea. Nevertheless, it interests me how we're changing based on our new diets collectively.  
  
That got me thinking about what people used to eat, and maybe it's better for quality of life to change diets back to what our ancestors used to eat (like a Paleo diet). But then again, wouldn't it have varied quite a lot? For example, an ancient Mediterranean diet would not be the same as say, a Scandinavian diet.  
  
I've been interested in going back to my own heritage and seeing what they eat. For example, if I came from a specific region in Asia, or was a Native American, could I find out what they ate?

ppg912,Do carbohydrates not mix well with animal fats or something?,"It seems in my study of nutrition, there's two prominent schools of thought, both advocating for eating less processed or whole foods.

1) the plant-based school of thought, that lots of diseases are caused by eating too many animal products.  And when people cut out animal products completely, their diseases reverse.  (the most radical example is Kempner's work where he got people to reverse diabetes, kidney disease, hypertension, and heart failure by eating only white rice and fruits and sugar)

2) the ketosis or paleo style school of thought that argues about the benefits of a lot of good quality fat from animal products when they're pasture raised, and the skepticism about consuming grains or in some cases all carbohydrates.  And I've heard of a lot of people having benefits from a keto diet when they cut out carbs as much as possible, consuming calories of mostly fats from butter, eggs, and meat (it seems like there's some studies of it reversing heart failure and diabetes).

My wondering is that since it seems there are benefits from cutting out carbs completely or cutting out animal fats completely, is there something about those two things not mixing well together in our body?  Or is it just the over-processing of them that's making things unhealthy (like with cereal/milk, hamburgers, and pizza)?",nutrition,0

But if it's a myth...that can only mean that protein can stay longer than common sources say so (6-8 hours) in the small intestine.

Say one eats 60 g of egg protein in one meal, which digests at around 3 g an hour. Would that protein stay in the small intestine for 20 hours, until it's all absorbed? Are there any studies looking at how much of a protein rich meal like this would be absorbed, and in how long?

If not, is there an upper limit to how long the protein would stay? Because if it indeed is only 6-8 hours, that would not only prove the 30 g per meal limit true, but actually make it an overstatement, as 3g per hour times 8 hours gives only a maximum of 24 grams absorbed.

I tested my Omega 6 and Omega 3 - the results were:

Firstly,  I notice the test uses EPA as the Omega-3. I guess this excludes DHA. Can DHA be tested?

Secondly, my functional medicine doctor recommended [https://bodybio.co.uk/products/bodybio-balance-oil](https://bodybio.co.uk/products/bodybio-balance-oil) \- but looking at it after my appointment, I notice it has sunflower oil. I know sunflower oil oxidises when heated, and this product is cold pressed, so I think that's fine..

pmxt8a,Science-Based Healthy Diet,"Hi everyone, I made this outline for myself originally but would like to share it since it's not doing me much good sitting idly in my google docs. I made this diet outline based on food science and what has been actually proven to enhance your body's various systems (cognitive, gastrointestinal, etc.). I've done my best to derive nutrients from natural sources and to minimize the use of supplements as part of the diet. Any scrutiny is welcomed because I'd like to remove any pseudo-science from the diet, let alone spread it. Food suggestions for the different categories are appreciated too. I hope this helps as a simplified nutritional guideline for those overwhelmed with the amount of information on ""healthy"" diets out there. You can find a breakdown of the benefits of the different compounds and why they were chosen as categories in the first comment.

**“The more ingredients there are, the worse it is for you”**

Avoid processed foods, always opt for the whole grain option, eat fruits and vegetables and try to eat more vegetable-based protein and less animal protein. That's about it. It's cliché at this point, but food writer Michael Pollan's famous quote, ""Eat food, not too much, mostly plants,"" still applies here.

**Healthy foods:**

Probiotic Support (Kimchi, Sauerkraut, Olives, Yogurt, Emmental cheese, Cheddar, Parmesan, Romano, Provolone, Whole grains, Garlic, Kombucha, Kefir)

Omega 3s | Protein (Salmon, Cod, Mahi-mahi, Mackerel, Perch, Oysters, Rainbow trout, Sea bass, Tuna, Avocados, Chicken, Beef)

Flavonoids (&lt; 70% Cocoa, Onions, Parsley, Berries, Citrus, Black tea, Oolong tea, Green tea, Red wine)
Curcumin (Yellow curry spice)

Veggies (Green peas, Pinto beans, Kidney beans, Chickpeas, Corn, Spinach, Collard greens, Green beans, Asparagus, Brussels sprouts, Mushrooms, Potatoes, Broccoli, Kale, Zucchini, Carrots)

Fruits (Bananas, Strawberries, Apples, Mangos, Pomegranates, Pineapples, Watermelon, Cantaloupe, Grapefruits, Grapes, Pears, Plums, Peaches)

Fiber (Oats, Cereal, Lentils, Split peas, Artichokes, Almonds, Pistachios, Walnuts)


No:

Saturated fats (e.g. greasy food)
Trans fats (coffee creamer, margarine)
Refined carbs (processed bread)
High sugar / HFCS
Smoking

Supplement:
Omega 3s
Multivitamin

pmxqnp,How many grams of natural (fruit) sugar shouldn’t be exceeded in consumption while reducing body fat as much as possible?,"How many grams of natural (fruit) sugar should I not exceed in consuming while reducing as much body fat as possible?

**Background**:


I know the difference between natural sugar (fruit) and added sugar (processed food).
AFAIK, different health organizations sources suggest to consume less than 25 grams of added sugar per day. Others suggest instead to consume added sugar within a limit of 38 grams per day.

I think both of these informations are reliable regarding _added_ sugar. When I can avoid it, it’s better though.


**Questions:**

1. My aim is to reduce as much fat as possible (getting around 10% of body fat). Maximally, how many **grams** of natural sugar should be consumed per day?
2. MyFitnessPal suggests me to stay below the 92 grams limit of sugars. Why? Is this suggestion reliable at all for my aim I’ve talked about in the last question?
3. Let’s say I make (for example) some peach juice with my electric juicer. Do the natural sugars of the juice affect my body just the same way the whole fruit (peach) does?",nutrition,0

- male

- 5’7

Lost 40 pound of fat over a year period, but unfortunately seem to have lost a lot of muscle in the process.

I know many will see this as extreme but I’ve been at this deficit for some time now - alongside intermittent fasting - with no issues, now I’m incorporating the strength training and high protein diet.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5FLp1YqPO4&amp;t=201s

Sorry (and this question is gonna sound kind of crude), but if this is true, along with the fact that vegans are recommended to get 50% more zinc than non-vegans ([source](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26502280/)) due to anti-nutrients in plant sources of zinc (meaning 16.5mg of zinc a day for males), how is a vegan man – without supplementing – supposed to get enough zinc from plant sources if they masturbate, say, 5 times a day? That would require getting ~30mg of zinc a day, assuming the ""50% more zinc"" rule does not apply to the 3mg of zinc lost per ejaculation. 

And, since zinc is important for testosterone production, what should vegan men who don't supplement and ejaculate frequently be recommended to do? This sounds like a stupid question, but, seriously, if someone is ejaculating 10+ times a day (50+ mg) and not supplementing, they're probably going to be zinc deficient if they're vegan ... or am I wrong?",nutrition,0

pkug2b,Calorie food and Food's carbon footprint,"Hello,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm really into nutrition and I always like to take a look at [https://nutritiondata.self.com/](https://nutritiondata.self.com/) to know the number of fat/carb/proteins. I'm more and more aware that the food we eat also has an impact on the planet. Indeed, importing avocado to Europe has a big carbon footprint.   
Do you know if it exists a website/database where I could have a mix between [nutritiondata.com](https://nutritiondata.com) and knowing the carbon footprint for each food? Ideally, I would like a website where we have thorough calorie details about a food/recipe you compose and the impact carbon of it.

Something a little bit like that: [https://www.carbonfact.co/](https://www.carbonfact.co/) (it is for shoes)

pks3w4,"Trying to start my first diet at 32, need any advice for what I should watch out for in terms of the percents on box (or any other tips really)","So I’m trying to lose weight, which will be hard due to medical diagnosis and really a sedentary lifestyle (bad back from sports so it’s hard for me to walk to help lose weight).

I’ve heard so much of “this diet is a fad diet” or “this isn’t medically a safe diet” going on so it’s hard to really learn conflicting information for the first time. One site will say red meat is fine and another says it’s horrible for you and I can’t tell what’s right or not you know?

I’m trying to help why starting portion control. My cooking has been limited to super basic or microwave food.

So to start I’m trying to cut down by not ordering out as much and i found some lean cuisine meals that have low calories but high sodium that I’m trying to eat. I’ll have some bananas or apple and try to eat better stuff when I snack like yogurt and am trying to get soft drinks off the table entirely.

I know the lean cuisine meals probably aren’t healthy but are there any quick options that could help the transition of eating meals outside to eating less tastier meals at home?

pkaov2,"Avocado Consumption, Abdominal Adiposity, and Oral Glucose Tolerance Among Persons with Overweight and Obesity","ABSTRACT

**Background:** Although intake of Hass avocado has been cross-sectionally linked to lower abdominal obesity, knowledge of the effects of avocado consumption on abdominal adiposity and glycemic outcomes remains limited. 


**Objective:** The effects of avocado consumption on abdominal adiposity, insulin resistance, oral-glucose-tolerance test (OGTT), and estimated β-cell function were evaluated.


**Methods:** A total of 105 adults aged 25–45 y (61% female) with BMI ≥25 kg/m2 were randomly assigned to an intervention (N = 53) that received a daily meal with 1 fresh Hass avocado or a control (N = 52) that received an isocaloric meal with similar ingredients without avocado for 12 wk. DXA was used to assess the primary outcomes of abdominal adiposity [visceral adipose tissue (VAT), subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue (SAAT), and the ratio of VAT to SAAT (VS Ratio)]. Fasted glucose and insulin were used to assess the primary outcomes of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and insulin sensitivity (Matsuda index) and β-cell function (Insulinogenic index) were estimated using an OGTT. Changes between groups were compared using an ANCOVA. Secondary analyses were conducted based on sex.


**Results:** The control group exhibited a greater reduction in SAAT [–54.5 ± 155.8 g (control) compared with 17.4 ± 155.1 g (treatment), P = 0.017] and increase in VS Ratio [0.007 ± 0.047 (control) compared with –0.011 ± 0.044 (treatment), P = 0.024]. Among females, the treatment group exhibited a greater reduction in VAT [1.6 ± 89.8 g (control) compared with –32.9 ± 81.6 g (treatment), P = 0.021] and VS Ratio [0.01 ± 0.05 (control) compared with –0.01 ± 0.03 (treatment), P = 0.001]. Among males, there was no significant difference between groups in changes in abdominal adiposity or glycemic outcomes.


**Conclusions:** Daily consumption of 1 fresh Hass avocado changed abdominal adiposity distribution among females but did not facilitate improvements in peripheral insulin sensitivity or β-cell function among adults with overweight and obesity. This study was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02740439. J Nutr 2021;151:2513–2521.

Our aim was to determine the effect of diet on gut microbiota, digestive function and sensations, using an integrated clinical, metagenomics and metabolomics approach. We conducted a cross-over, randomised study on the effects of a Western-type diet versus a fibre-enriched Mediterranean diet. In 20 healthy men, each diet was administered for 2 weeks preceded by a 2-week washout diet. The following outcomes were recorded: (a) number of anal gas evacuations; (b) digestive sensations; (c) volume of gas evacuated after a probe meal; (d) colonic content by magnetic resonance imaging; (e) gut microbiota taxonomy and metabolic functions by shotgun sequencing of faecal samples; (f) urinary metabolites using untargeted metabolomics. As compared to a Western diet, the Mediterranean diet was associated with (i) higher number of anal gas evacuations, (ii) sensation of flatulence and borborygmi, (iii) larger volume of gas after the meal and (iv) larger colonic content. Despite the relatively little difference in microbiota composition between both diets, microbial metabolism differed substantially, as shown by urinary metabolite profiles and the abundance of microbial metabolic pathways. The effects of the diet were less evident in individuals with robust microbiotas (higher beta-diversity). To conclude, healthy individuals tolerate dietary changes with minor microbial modifications at the composition level but with remarkable variation in microbial metabolism.

Long story short I ordered some ""Amazon elements"" brand and the thing has a whopping total of 268mg of vitamin e. This is insanely high. 1,787% the daily value. 

So I heard there's risks with overdoing vitamin e. And I only really wanna take like 10-15mg a day. So do some math and that's about one every 20 days. Is this something I can do? Or will the huge amount all at once still carry some risks even if I only take one every 20 days?

This is my main question and all I really need help with, I can research for my other question don't feel like you need to help me with that Ill be alright :)

So my side question is If this isn't something I should do. Can one maybe reccomend Me to a trusted as in (lab tested and safe) brand that has versions of vitamin e with 10-15 mg? Or maybe some specific food to get or something? It's hard to travel as I don't have a car so I'd prefer to order a vitamin off Amazon rather than go to a store for food, but if I gotta then I gotta :)

piqp0s,Phyic Acid in Overnight Oats?," A lot of overnight oats recipes don't include any acids (i.e. lemon juice) and this is confusing to me because:

The purpose of lemon juice is to break down phytic acid, which is found in the liquid the oats were soaked in.

Phytic acid binds to important minerals such as zinc and iron, so your body doesn't actually end up getting to use these nutrients. Therefore, it's important to get rid of phytic acid before you consume the oats.   
(It's also why a lot of times you have to soak legumes/beans as part of cooking prep). 

This info is also just from researching for... not a very long time lol (but I did look at NCBI so not just random sites). 

And I found a lot of blogs that say ""oops we forgot to say you should include lemon juice or apple cider vinegar!"" For the reasons stated above. Yet none of the actual recipe sites indicate this?? Maybe this is just one of those common sense things that people don't need to specify?

I did make 1 jar of PB &amp; banana overnight oats and added a ""splash"" of lemon juice. If you were wondering, I couldn't really taste the lemon juice but at the same time Idk how much you need to add (in proportion to the oats) to sufficiently break down the phytic acid grr.

* dietary dictates of the past century overwhelmingly reflect the corporate interests of the Pharmaceutical Industry, the Food Industry, and the religious doctrine of the Seventh  Day Adventist Church.

But how many can discern the inverse relationship Omega 3s have with trans fats? What about the prevalence of these harmful fatty acids?

Viewing the evidence, it appears consumption of fried foods and trans fats can cause mild birth defects that permanently harm cognition of offspring. It can be explained by neurotoxicity decreasing the ability of endogenous antioxidants[^(\[34\])](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC7231579/) and altering Omega 3 metabolism. This can lead to a weaker prefrontal cortex (PFC), enhanced addictive behavior and decreased cognition. Theoretically, this could directly play into the pathogenesis of ADHD, and its frequent occurrence.

In 2018 the FDA placed a ban on trans fats, when ironically the makers of partial hydrogenation were given a nobel prize in 1912. This post serves as a testament to the cruelty of modernity, its implications in cognitive dysfunction, and what you should stay away from.

**Trans fats, abundant in the western diet:**

* **Surprisingly common:** The temperature at which foods are fried renders common cooking oils trans fats.[^(\[1\])](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0308814616309141)[^(\[2\])](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24033334/) Time worsens this reaction, though it transitions exponentially and within minutes. It is not uncommon for oil to be heated for hours. Given how inseperable fried food is from western cuisine, especially in low income areas (think fast food, southern cooking), this demands more attention.
* **Seasoning matters:** There appears to be mild evidence that frying at a lower heat, and with rosemary, can reduce trans fats formation supposedly due to antioxidant properties.[^(\[17\])](https://grasasyaceites.revistas.csic.es/index.php/grasasyaceites/article/view/689/700)

**The relationship of trans fats, polyunsaturated fats and mental disorders:**

* **Trans fats may cause an Omega 3 deficiency:** Omega 3s are primarily known for their anti-inflammatory effects, usually secondary to DHA and EPA. But there's more to it than that. Trans fats block the conversion of ALA to EPA and DHA.[^(\[3\])](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC4190204/) This means that in some, trans fats can upset Omega 3 function in a similar manner to a deficiency.
* **ADHD:** There is significant correlation betweens **ADHD** and trans fats exposure.[^(\[20\])](https://sci-hub.se/https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1651-2227.2012.02726.x) It seems the inverse relationship between Omega 3s and trans fats is multifaceted. A major role of Omega 3s, and its relevance to **ADHD** is its potent neurotrophic activity in the PFC.[^(\[10\])](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC2844685/) Studies have found that **ADHD** is associated with weaker function and structure of PFC circuits, especially in the right hemisphere.[^(\[11\])](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC2894421/) Trans fats have a negative effect on offspring BDNF, learning and memory.[^(\[21\])](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25394793/) Omega 3s inhibit MAOB in the PFC[^(\[6\])](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9868201/), which decreases oxidative stress and toxicity from dopamine, and simultaneously inhibits its breakdown. Of less relevance, various MAOIs have been investigated as potential treatments for **ADHD**.[^(\[7\])](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/owmcgz/2003_seligiline_treats_adhd_with_less_side/)[^(\[8\])](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1546129/)[^(\[9\])](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10216387/) Unfortunately, most meta analyses concluded Omega 3 ineffective for **ADHD**, however they are majorly flawed as an Omega 3 deficiency is not cured until a minimal of 3 months.[^(\[22\])](https://sci-hub.se/https://www.jaacap.org/article/S0890-8567(11)00484-9/fulltext)[^(\[23\])](https://sci-hub.se/https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022395618310185?via%3Dihub) Omega 3s have been proposed to help **ADHD** for a long time, but if they are to help through neurogenesis and a transition in pathways, it would be a long-term process. While **ADHD** may acutely function better with a low quality, dopamine-releasing diet containing trans fats[^(\[23\])](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC6572510/) and while Omega 3s may, through anti-inflammatory/ anti-oxidant mechanisms, partially attenuate mother's offspring stimulant-induced increases in dopamine/ D1 density, downregulated D2 density[^(\[24\])](https://sci-hub.se/https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs12640-015-9549-5), this is not an argument in favor for trans fats or agaist Omega 3; rather, data hints at trans fat induced CDK5 activation, secondary to dopamine release. The mechanism by which trans fats may increase dopamine lead to dysregulation, as explained in posts prior to this one.[^(\[25\])](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/ovfzwg/a_sciencebased_analysis_on_dopamine_upregulation/)
* **Bipolar disorder:** DHA deficiency and thus lack of PFC protection is associated with **bipolar disorder**.[^(\[12\])](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC2838627/)  **Bipolar depression** is significantly improved by supplementary Omega 3s.[^(\[14\])](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21903025/) This could be largely in part due to the modulatory effect of Omega 3s on neurotransmitters.
* **Generalized anxiety:** Trans fat is linked to More trans fats in red blood cell fatty acid composition is associated with worse stress and **anxiety**. More Omega 3s and Omega 6s have positive effects.[^(\[15\])](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC7193237/) Trans fat intake during pregnancy or lactation increases **anxiety**\-like behavior and alters proinflammatory cytokines and glucocorticoid receptor levels in the hippocampus of adult offspring.[^(\[16\])](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0361923020307024) In addition, Omega 3s were shown to improve stress and **anxiety** in both healthy humans[^(\[27\])](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC3191260/) and mice[^(\[26\])](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC6308198/). Some possible explanations are changes to inflammatory response, BDNF, cortisol, and cardiovascular activity.[^(\[28\])](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30264663/)
* **Autism:** Maternal intake of Omega 3s and polyunsaturated fats inversely correlates with **autism**, however trans fat intakes do not significantly increase chances after proper adjustment.[^(\[4\])](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23813699/)[^(\[18\])](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC3988447/) Maternal immune activation (MIA), mother fighting a virus/ bacteria during pregnancy, is thought to increase the risk of **autism** and **ADHD** in the offspring. A deficiency in Omega 3s during pregnancy worsened these effects, enhancing the damage to the gut microbiome.[^(\[5\])](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41386-020-00793-7) The data suggests trans fats have only a loose correlation with **autism**, whereas prenatal Omega 3 deficiency is more severe. Omega 3 supplementation can improve traits unrelated to functioning and social behavior.[^(\[19\])](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC5634395/)

**Other toxicity of trans fats:**

* **Under-researched dangers:** Combining trans fat with palmitate (common saturated fat) exaggerates the toxic effects of trans fat.[^(\[29\])](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30572061/)
* **Cardiotoxic:** Trans fat is cardiotoxic and linked to heart disease.[^(\[30\])](https://sci-hub.se/https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0278691515000435)

**Other studies on fried food:**

* **Depression and anxiety:** High fried food intake associated with higher risk for **depression.**[^(\[31\])](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC5025553/) a western diet, containing fried foods, is found to increase risk of **depression** and **anxiety**.[^(\[33\])](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20048020/)
* **Cognition (relevant to ADHD):** Children develop better when mothers consume fish and avoid fried food.[^(\[32\])](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC5623570/)
* **Bipolar disorder:** Fried foods are craved significantly more by those with bipolar disorder, and likely eaten more frequently.

pg6fnm,"The relationship between fried foods, Omega 3s and mental health.","Many of us are familiar with the benefits of Omega 3s: from cognition enhancement, to heart health, to lowering inflammation, and more. But how many can discern the inverse relationship Omega 3s have with trans fats? What about the prevalence of these harmful fatty acids?

Viewing the evidence, it appears consumption of fried foods and trans fats can cause mild birth defects that permanently harm cognition of offspring. It can be explained by neurotoxicity decreasing the ability of endogenous antioxidants[^(\[34\])](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC7231579/) and altering Omega 3 metabolism. This can lead to a weaker prefrontal cortex (PFC), enhanced addictive behavior and decreased cognition. Theoretically, this could directly play into the pathogenesis of ADHD, and its frequent occurrence.

In 2018 the FDA placed a ban on trans fats, when ironically the makers of partial hydrogenation were given a nobel prize in 1912. This post serves as a testament to the cruelty of modernity, its implications in cognitive dysfunction, and what you should stay away from.

**Trans fats, abundant in the western diet:**

* **Surprisingly common:** The temperature at which foods are fried renders common cooking oils trans fats.[^(\[1\])](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0308814616309141)[^(\[2\])](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24033334/) Time worsens this reaction, though it transitions exponentially and within minutes. It is not uncommon for oil to be heated for hours. Given how inseperable fried food is from western cuisine, especially in low income areas (think fast food, southern cooking), this demands more attention.
* **Seasoning matters:** There appears to be mild evidence that frying at a lower heat, and with rosemary, can reduce trans fats formation supposedly due to antioxidant properties.[^(\[17\])](https://grasasyaceites.revistas.csic.es/index.php/grasasyaceites/article/view/689/700)

**The relationship of trans fats, polyunsaturated fats and mental disorders:**

* **Trans fats may cause an Omega 3 deficiency:** Omega 3s are primarily known for their anti-inflammatory effects, usually secondary to DHA and EPA. But there's more to it than that. Trans fats block the conversion of ALA to EPA and DHA.[^(\[3\])](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC4190204/) This means that in some, trans fats can upset Omega 3 function in a similar manner to a deficiency.
* **ADHD:** There is significant correlation betweens **ADHD** and trans fats exposure.[^(\[20\])](https://sci-hub.se/https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1651-2227.2012.02726.x) It seems the inverse relationship between Omega 3s and trans fats is multifaceted. A major role of Omega 3s, and its relevance to **ADHD** is its potent neurotrophic activity in the PFC.[^(\[10\])](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC2844685/) Studies have found that **ADHD** is associated with weaker function and structure of PFC circuits, especially in the right hemisphere.[^(\[11\])](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC2894421/) Trans fats have a negative effect on offspring BDNF, learning and memory.[^(\[21\])](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25394793/) Omega 3s inhibit MAOB in the PFC[^(\[6\])](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9868201/), which decreases oxidative stress and toxicity from dopamine, and simultaneously inhibits its breakdown. Of less relevance, various MAOIs have been investigated as potential treatments for **ADHD**.[^(\[7\])](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/owmcgz/2003_seligiline_treats_adhd_with_less_side/)[^(\[8\])](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1546129/)[^(\[9\])](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10216387/) Unfortunately, most meta analyses concluded Omega 3 ineffective for **ADHD**, however they are majorly flawed as an Omega 3 deficiency is not cured until a minimal of 3 months.[^(\[22\])](https://sci-hub.se/https://www.jaacap.org/article/S0890-8567(11)00484-9/fulltext)[^(\[23\])](https://sci-hub.se/https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022395618310185?via%3Dihub) Omega 3s have been proposed to help **ADHD** for a long time, but if they are to help through neurogenesis and a transition in pathways, it would be a long-term process. While **ADHD** may acutely function better with a low quality, dopamine-releasing diet containing trans fats[^(\[23\])](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC6572510/) and while Omega 3s may, through anti-inflammatory/ anti-oxidant mechanisms, partially attenuate mother's offspring stimulant-induced increases in dopamine/ D1 density, downregulated D2 density[^(\[24\])](https://sci-hub.se/https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs12640-015-9549-5), this is not an argument in favor for trans fats or agaist Omega 3; rather, data hints at trans fat induced CDK5 activation, secondary to dopamine release. The mechanism by which trans fats may increase dopamine lead to dysregulation, as explained in posts prior to this one.[^(\[25\])](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/ovfzwg/a_sciencebased_analysis_on_dopamine_upregulation/)
* **Bipolar disorder:** DHA deficiency and thus lack of PFC protection is associated with **bipolar disorder**.[^(\[12\])](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC2838627/)  **Bipolar depression** is significantly improved by supplementary Omega 3s.[^(\[14\])](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21903025/) This could be largely in part due to the modulatory effect of Omega 3s on neurotransmitters.
* **Generalized anxiety:** Trans fat is linked to More trans fats in red blood cell fatty acid composition is associated with worse stress and **anxiety**. More Omega 3s and Omega 6s have positive effects.[^(\[15\])](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC7193237/) Trans fat intake during pregnancy or lactation increases **anxiety**\-like behavior and alters proinflammatory cytokines and glucocorticoid receptor levels in the hippocampus of adult offspring.[^(\[16\])](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0361923020307024) In addition, Omega 3s were shown to improve stress and **anxiety** in both healthy humans[^(\[27\])](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC3191260/) and mice[^(\[26\])](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC6308198/). Some possible explanations are changes to inflammatory response, BDNF, cortisol, and cardiovascular activity.[^(\[28\])](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30264663/)
* **Autism:** Maternal intake of Omega 3s and polyunsaturated fats inversely correlates with **autism**, however trans fat intakes do not significantly increase chances after proper adjustment.[^(\[4\])](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23813699/)[^(\[18\])](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC3988447/) Maternal immune activation (MIA), mother fighting a virus/ bacteria during pregnancy, is thought to increase the risk of **autism** and **ADHD** in the offspring. A deficiency in Omega 3s during pregnancy worsened these effects, enhancing the damage to the gut microbiome.[^(\[5\])](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41386-020-00793-7) The data suggests trans fats have only a loose correlation with **autism**, whereas prenatal Omega 3 deficiency is more severe. Omega 3 supplementation can improve traits unrelated to functioning and social behavior.[^(\[19\])](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC5634395/)

**Other toxicity of trans fats:**

* **Under-researched dangers:** Combining trans fat with palmitate (common saturated fat) exaggerates the toxic effects of trans fat.[^(\[29\])](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30572061/)
* **Cardiotoxic:** Trans fat is cardiotoxic and linked to heart disease.[^(\[30\])](https://sci-hub.se/https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0278691515000435)

**Other studies on fried food:**

* **Depression and anxiety:** High fried food intake associated with higher risk for **depression.**[^(\[31\])](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC5025553/) a western diet, containing fried foods, is found to increase risk of **depression** and **anxiety**.[^(\[33\])](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20048020/)
* **Cognition (relevant to ADHD):** Children develop better when mothers consume fish and avoid fried food.[^(\[32\])](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC5623570/)
* **Bipolar disorder:** Fried foods are craved significantly more by those with bipolar disorder, and likely eaten more frequently.

The main problem is that i really only get to have protien those 3 times, minus a shake after a workout in the afternoon. So most of my meals i end up trying to eat around 40-60g of protien in a sitting, which back home i would try to span out in many small meals.

pfa2pn,Say Goodbye To Sugar Cravings With Intermittent Fasting,"Chocolate, cookies, ice cream – a sweet tooth’s lover's dream! Indulging in an occasional treat is good for your emotional well-being. But when you consume sugar regularly, your body is never satisfied.

Of the more than 600,000 food products found on the typical grocery’s shelf, 80 percent contain added sugar. The average person consumes one pound of sugar a day 

Sugar cravings can be difficult to overcome but intermittent fasting can help. When one begins fasting for the day, the hunger-suppressing hormone leptin levels initially increase, appetite decreases and sweet tooth desires lessen. 

When one stays in a fasted state for a long period, leptin levels start to drop. This may cause feelings of increased hunger and desires for sugar the first couple of weeks. As leptin levels normalize, hunger and sugar cravings subside and in time the sugar craving cycle can be broken.

I've read multiple studies (somewhat older). The best seemed to be the ""Lancet 2018 Hallmark Metastudy Risk thresholds for alcohol consumption: combined analysis of individual-participant data for 599 912 current drinkers in 83 prospective studies""
with the main conclusion being ""In comparison to those who reported drinking &gt;0–≤100 g per week, those who reported drinking &gt;100–≤200 g per week, &gt;200–≤350 g per week, or &gt;350 g per week had lower life expectancy at age 40 years of approximately 6 months, 1–2 years, or 4–5 years, respectively.  Associations were similar for men and women (appendix p 26), but weaker at older ages (appendix p 27)."".

Moderate consumption is around one to two drinks a day, or a total of 7 to 14 drinks a week which boils down to 100-200gr alcohol a week if my mathematics are correct.

I am in that range, drinking 1 to 3 drinks on 3 to 5 days a week, and would like to continue doing so. What are the newest insights in the harmfulness of this level of consumption and any ways to help mitigate or minimise any harm beyond reducing alcohol?

Is there literature supporting this?,"So I recently learned that for centuries, working people in Europe ate their most significant meal during the afternoon. Breakfast would be something that's readily available in the morning like eggs, dairy or something that could be prepared overnight without any oversight like oats. Dinner would be enjoyed in the afternoon and be a heavy meal that consist of fish, meat, veggies and carbs to fuel yourself for heavy labor throughout the day and supper would be a light meal of bread, soup, cured meats, etc. 

It became fashionable for the upper classes (aka people who did jack shit all day) to start postponing dinner later and later until they ended up eating dinner in the evening. The industrial revolution sealed the deal because strict work times meant the working class only had time for quick, prepared lunches during the afternoon. 

When you think about it it makes little sense, why would you eat light before the busiest time of the day and then fill yourself up to just lie around and sleep? That's how you end up with late afternoon sugar dips. I would even go as far as to speculate that not being full during the busiest time of day is a big factor when it comes to overeating.

peii2y,What I learnt about dairy products after being lactose intolerant (and avoiding lactose) for the last 15 years.,"I wanted to make this post about lactose intolerance (NOT dairy allergy) in the hope that people who have recently found out they are lactose intolerant or want to try to avoid lactose will save themselves the hassle and not make the same mistakes I did for the last 15 years. 

**What is lactose intolerance?**

It is when our bodies cannot break down a sugar found in milk called lactose.

Our bodies use an enzyme called lactase to break down that sugar so we can absorb it into our bodies. But people with lactose intolerance don’t have enough lactase. It’s produced in the small intestine.

Around 40% of people are lactose intolerant from the age of 2 and can cause things like gas, bloating and diarrhea.

Many people don’t know that lactose intolerant people can have many forms of dairy without the nasty side affects.

For instance: Extra Mature Cheddar, Parmigiano Reggiano, Comté are all hard cows cheeses which (if aged enough) have very little to no lactose compared to milk, butter, or soft cows cheeses. This is because the aging process converts lactose into lactic acid. 

https://www.nutrition.org.uk/nutritionscience/allergy/lactose-intolerance.html?start=2

You see it especially with very aged parmigiana reggiano - little crystals forming which signs of that conversion. 

Other cheeses are those made with Goats milk, sheep’s milk, or buffalo milk  haven’t got substantially lower amounts of lactose but due to having a different protein and fat makeup, anecdotal evidence suggests that these milks and their cheeses may be easier to digest. 


https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/does-goat-milk-have-lactose#lactose-in-goat-milk

Of course if you have a dairy allergy you can’t have any of those cheeses or dairy, and someone who has a severe intolerance should still avoid all dairy but it’s worth telling your friends who are lactose intolerant, that there’s a wide variety of cheeses that they can (probably) digest very well.

Yours sincerely, a lactose intolerant cheese fanatic.

pehw4p,"Is there any real difference between consuming natural sugar from a fruit, and added sugar, so long as the added sugar is paired with fiber and other nutrients?","A specific example would be something like Ensure.

If that is true, then is there really any real difference between consuming the ensure, and consuming the fruit? The ensure has protein, fat, and fiber added (some of them at least.) so it is paired with these things.

One caveat here, is I realize the ensure won't have the antioxidants a fruit will have.

I find this confusing too because the argument about fruits being healthier than regular sugar plus a fiber supplement is because the fiber molecules are embedded in the sugars, so would that mean that if you don't eat the skin then you are only losing out on essential nutrients and not necessarily spiking your blood sugar because the fiber within the flesh is the only fiber that is embedded in the sugars/carbohydrates?",nutrition,0

I’ve always had a negative connotation of fluoride. I heard it could cause calcification of the pineal gland, and apparently in excess can cause dental issues.

Allegedly, inadequate fluoride intake can also cause dental issues, though rare to see a deficiency in it.

pcrwjw,/r/Nutrition sub update - addressing anti-science misinformation,"## We need to talk about anti-science misinformation

It's one thing when there are conflicting opinions and conclusions regarding some specific area of nutrition.  That's fine and is ideal for participants here to throw back and forth. It's another thing altogether when someone is wholly anti-science.  We're not talking about cases of ""is this a 6 or a 9"", we're talking about cases of ""there are no numbers""

Science is real.  Science is necessary.  This sub is for and about the science of nutrition. While it is not the subreddit's place to enforce a side in disagreements over interpretations of data / studies / research, we feel it is incumbent upon us to address anti-science narratives. 

It is not informative, helpful, or productive when someone comes to this sub and is not engaging in facts, is utterly resistant to providing any facts, is solely reliant on youtube videos as a basis for their claims, and ultimately responds to any debate with conspiracy claims.   A completely fact resistant mindset based on gut feelings and ""somebody dun sed an I dont care who"" is not engaging in good faith whatsoever.

While we sympathize with concerns about corporate interests, it is a problem when folks are coming here to specifically bash any and all science and try to discredit every bit of it with ""funding bias"" and ""Big food and Big pharma"" kinds of comments. THE biggest problem misinformation angle in the nutrition sub are science rejection comments, and not just rejection of some specific thing but those which are actively promoting ""don't trust any science"". 

Again, the science of any specific facet of nutrition is always welcomed to be debated here, it's part of the purpose of the sub, but a debate of the validity of science itself is not.

Therefore, going forward;

* **""Science is a conspiracy"" type engagement is not allowed** - If instead of having a fact based discussion, your purpose here is to engage solely in unsubstantiated conspiracy generalizations and science denial, then you are likely to be banned. If conspiracy claims are your basis for discussion or you wish to question science itself, then you should instead utilize the subreddits which cater to those discussions as it is not on topic for this sub.

* **Automod will be removing certain kinds of anti-science and conspiracy comments**.  This will be very targeted to science denial rhetoric so as to ensure appropriate topical debate is left in place.

* **Any bias concerns need to be *specifically* addressed and cited rather than barfing up generalized funding bias hyperbole**. Pointing out a specific company or companies behind a specific study to express concerns about bias is more than acceptable for discussion here.  Blanket brushing all science / research / studies ever generated for funding bias is ridiculous conspiracy blather and is outside of reality.  It's a step way too far.

In addition to the above, we also ask you to vote accordingly and to let us know when you see

""all science BAD!""  
""all studies are a conspiracy and are biased!""  
""everything is a conspiracy!""  
""I aint gunna cite anything CUZ youtube SED I'z RIGHT!""

But we're usually told that 'fruit is fine' and 'eat all the fruit you want'. No one ever mentions the grams of sugar in a fruit smoothie... My understanding is that the sugar content of whole fruit gets a free pass because of the fiber that is packaged with it.

My question is then - are other fiber rich foods with similar sugar content just as OK as whole fruit? An average banana has 14 grams of sugar and 3 grams of fiber. That's 4.66 sugars per gram of fiber. An indie granola brand has 6 grams of sugar per serving, and 2 grams of fiber = 3 sugars per gram of fiber.

Ounce for ounce, is this granola a healthier option than the banana?  Another example:  If chia seeds (high fiber) are added to sugar-sweetened yogurt, and the sugar:fiber ratio is lower than that of a peach or a a banana, does that make it as healthy or healthier than whole fruit?",nutrition,0

as of now I’ve been living without added sugar for four months and it feels amazing! 
Now I’m also contemplating quitting fruit (cause evil fructose yadda yadda) and sugar-loaded veggies such as beet  and carrots (which I adore a bit too much) and I’m curious about anyone else’s experience on the matter. How did you feel after quitting this stuff cold turkey, what did you do to fight fruit cravings and has it actually helped you to achieve your health/aesthetic goals?

I’ve researched a lot of opinions/articles on the matter and it seems like all those wondrous vitamins and fiber can be consumed from other sources and fruit are really overrated

Of course, if we compare either of the two here towards chicken, tofu, fish, beans, and so on, the picture falls apart quickly and can be argued to be unhealthy compared to those food items.**

I'm not sure if I'm missing something, but if you look at Beyond Meats Ground beef, it appears to be healthier than that of normal ground beef (that is of 70% lean meat and 30% fat). Looking at the nutritional values for an equal amount (4oz vs 4oz), we see the following (difference between beyond meat and normal ground beef):

* Calories: 230 vs 332 (102 less calories)
* Total Fats: 14g vs 30g (16 grams less)
* Saturated Fats: 5g vs 11g (6 grams less)
* Trans Fat: 0 vs 1.8g (1.8 grams less)
* PolyFat: 3g vs 0g (3 grams more)
* MonoFat: 6g vs 0g (6 grams more)
* Cholesterol: 0 vs 78mg (78mg less)
* **sodium: 390 vs 67mg (323mg more)**
* Potassium: 330mg vs 218mg (112mg more)
* Carbohydrates: 7g vs 0g (7g more)
* Fiber: 2g vs 0g (2g more)
* Protein 20g vs 14g (6g more)

From a bird eye's view, it appears that beyond meats ground beef is ""healthier"" than that of ground beef, given that it has less saturated fats, more poly and mon fats, less cholesterol, higher pottasium, fiber, and protein content, while also being less in calories. However the only downside is the much higher sodium content which I've highlighted in bold. Now I do know that beyond meats beef patty is not healthier than that of a normal beef patty, but it appears here that the ground beef seems to be ""healthier"".",nutrition,0

There is 14g of sugar in this and the person who takes it only does so because they lack hunger and appetite. They weightlift and have an active lifestyle so they use the gainer to bulk.

p9h5x0,Is it really worth the extra price for organic feed vs just non-gmo feed livestock.,"I'm on a budget, and routinely get turkey/chicken, so this question comes up a lot in my head.

I found a brand I respect and like, and they offer an organic version of their products, and a regular version. 

Both versions are **exactly** the same, (same housing, natural growth/slaughtering times, same pasture fields, no hormones, no antibiotics, same food, treatment etc...) except for the one distinction being that the organic version feeds the livestock with non-gmo feed, whereas the organic (obviously) feeds the livestock with purely organic feed. (keep in mind the non-organic feed still does not have hormones/stimulants/antibiotics).

The organic products are however like 3 dollars more expensive, and that adds up tremendously when budgeting and often as much as I do.

So my question is, considering all other aspects of the turkey/chicken are the same, is non-organic feed a serious deal breaker, and worth putting extra money towards organic feed? Or is it more of a small preference at the end of the day, and not really important?",nutrition,0

We all know the importance of protein. But their discovery of the 'The Protein *Leverage* Hypothesis' puts a lot of things in their place\*. I couldn't find a real good article, but in this little seen video presentation is great. You can skip the introduction and jump right in at 3:14

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWYodd5xaGA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWYodd5xaGA) (part I)  
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Wm5X49XW8g](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Wm5X49XW8g) (part II)

\*“Surprisingly, we overeat fats and carbs not because the appetites for these nutrients are stronger, but because the appetite for *protein* is strongest of all! If protein is diluted in the food supply, we overeat until we satisfy our protein appetite. On high-protein diets, the protein appetite will be satisfied sooner—when fewer total calories have been eaten. This is what we call the Protein Leverage effect.

“But more protein is not necessarily better. Eating too much protein switches on biological processes that hasten aging and shorten lives.”

p6xwv2,Why do I not crave anything?,"Hello guys, first time here so apologies if I'm on the wrong subreddit.


I noticed that recently I haven't been craving food at all. Even when I get hungry I just eat, but I don't really crave a particular food. I am wondering if that's normal or if this sudden loss of appetite should be checked. Thank you",nutrition,0
p6vzqa,What's really happening in the body when someone is rapidly losing body weight because of hyperthyroidism and gaining weight because of hypothyroidism?,"What causes people with hypothyroidism to gain more weight and people with hyperthyroidism to lose weight so quickly, if we look at it from point of view of nutrition science? People with hypo claim that even though they don't eat much, they still gain weight. People with hyper claim that they can eat a lot of food, but can't gain any weight.

In fitness world, it's generally known that if you eat below your maintenance calories (TDEE) for your age, height and current weight, you should be losing weight. If you eat above maintenance, you should be gaining weight.

So my question is, how does hypo cause that you can get more weight, even though you eat at maintenance or below maintenance level? What exactly underactive thyroid does to the food/calories/nutrition eaten?
And same for hyper, how does overactive thyroid cause that you can't gain more weight? Does it make the hormonal system out of whack so much, that the body can't process the excees amount of calories, so whatever it doesn't process for the body to used effectively, it just goes straight to bowels and down the toilet? And otherwise for hypo?

p6vxbr,Question about Potassium Supplements?,"So Ive used my fitness pal for months now to track every single nutrients to perfect amounts and I noticed the one thing lacking dramatically is potassium. I was reading research papers and reports on how only about 10% of people globally get the required  **3,500–4,700 mg**  of Potassium daily. The benefits of Potassium are self explanatory; they're huge. 

**My question is why are all the potassium supplements all so low in potassium and where can I get a good brand of it? Almost all of the nutrient labels on the supplements have extremely low amounts of potassium, some as low as 90 mg** which is hilarious because it would be no different then not taking the supplement. **What is a supplement that is reputable and would get me to the required**   **3,500–4,700 mg**  of Potassium.

I like frozen veg too but it's limiting I think - foods like spinach or peas are great frozen, but you can't get salads or anything that should be eaten more crisp.

Ive been sprouting seeds at home and I love them!
Everywhere I read that they have all these great nutrients and I read in the past they were used to substitute vegetables on ships where it wasn't possible to get fresh.

I wonder, if I really couldn't get veg, but could maintain constant supply of sprouts of mixed seeds and beans, would this be healthy? Or is it like, better than nothing, but not optimal?

Im not sure if sprouts are missing any nutrients we need, or if you'd need to eat a huge impractical quantity daily to replace other greens.

So, a trainer has them start weight training a different muscle group daily, and loading up on protein shakes and carbohydrates (75g+ protein daily) - along with a normal healthy rounded diet.

With all these new calories, and especially carbs, how is this not going to just make the person fat? Or more specifically, what makes the weight/mass go to the muscles and not their belly?

Anyway, I was thinking of picking her up some groceries. Any ideas on nourishing ready-to-eat stuff?

And yes I know the best thing would be to ask her, but at this point I’m not sure she’d be able to help me put together a whole grocery list.

I do have a pretty good idea of some of her likes and dislikes based on the snacks she has around or things she has offered me (she definitely likes coconut and tropical fruits and has said she hates strawberry, for example).   No common allergens either based on what I’ve seen her eat so far (peanut butter cookies, candy with almonds, etc.).

p4tg9c,Laws Governing Medical Marijuana In The USA,"Each state has its own rules for the cultivation, sale and use of medicinal cannabis. Despite a doctor's recommendation you must follow the law if you use cannabis.

Most shops will have to check your medical cannabis card for entry in their authorization file. If you apply as a GP, the patient may need to come to your appointment. 

The laws on medical cannabis vary from state to state, but steps to become an authorized patient of medical marijuana are the same. Finding a licensed pharmacy in a state where cannabis is legal for medicinal purposes is easy. If a pharmacy accepts a valid card outside the state, read the section below to learn more about the laws of reciprocity. 

Most states have on their government websites a page with their cannabis laws, information on registration for a health card and a list of licensed dispensaries. For example, in New York, a state used exclusively for medical purposes, there are ten pharmacies with stores in four locations.

In the United States there are several dispensaries where patients can buy medical marijuana. Patients must present their medical marijuana license, medical recommendation, and valid ID as proof of identity. The purchase of medical cannabis from a licensed pharmacy is important to ensure a high quality product.

Medical marijuana can be found in capsule form, just like any other over-the-counter or prescription drug. Patients are advised by their doctor to grow a certain amount of medical marijuana, which can often be found by buying clones or seeds available in pharmacies. Dispensaries have different varieties and types of medical marijuana, and patients may need a staff member to help them with the right type of medical marijuana. 

There are various purchase options, including [medicinal cannabis](https://weedbudbase.com/) at will. Your licensed physician can assist you with any questions you may have, and our competent staff at the Pharm table are at your disposal if you need them.

Choose a state-certified pharmacy that will guide you through its high-quality products. In each of these pharmacies you can be sure that our quality standards are rigorous and trustworthy.

Medical cannabis dispensaries often grant concessions to patients that recreational stores do not. This is evident in Colorado, for example, where medical cannabis patients can avoid the 10% retail tax on marijuana and the 15% excise tax that recreational pharmacy customers have to pay. Medical cards allow patients to access their medicines at a lower cost and make their healthcare more affordable and accessible. 

Registered patients and caregivers may purchase medical CBD products at federally licensed dispensaries. Possession of any amount of cannabis outside a state-licensed CBD is punishable by up to six months in jail and a fine up to $1,000. Iowa also determines the permitted forms of CBD drugs and the CBD / THC ratio. 

The Iowa Legislature passed SF 2360, also known as the Medical Cannabidiol Act, in 2014, which allows licensed neurologists to certify the use of CBD products with a THC content of 3% or less for patients with persistent epilepsy.",nutrition,0

Liver support is 4 pills, yohimbine is 1 pill, Omega-3 is 1 pill, kidney support is 4 pills (Up to 3 times a day), bergamot is 2 pills, Calm+/Cortisol is 6 pills, and blood pressure support is 2 pills. This would mean that the daily intake would be a minimum of 20 pills daily...is there a method to divide all this throughout the week or is daily intake the most optimal?

p34dyq,Is all dietary fiber created equal?,"I understand the distinction between soluble and insoluble fiber, and that's it's important to get a variety of both in your diet.

 Lately I have seen more and more ""keto"" style bread products that have very low net carb counts and extremely high amounts of fiber. The most recent example being some bagels I tried from Aldi that are 90 calories each and have a whopping 29 grams of dietary fiber, which achieves the recommended daily value in a single snack. (I haven't experienced any GI distress, for what it's worth, though my body is pretty used to high fiber)

 This got me thinking about whether or not the fiber in these foods is ""as good"" as that from fresh fruit and vegetables. The ingredient lists always seem to have modified wheat starch, oat fiber, wheat gluten, whey protein isolate. 

So I guess my question is: am I still getting the health benefits of a high fiber diet if the majority of it is coming from these processed sources?",nutrition,0

p33s21,Trouble Balancing Macros Meeting The 1g/lb Recommendation,"Hello everyone, I have what may be a stupid question. How am I supposed to balance my macros while still meeting the recommended protein consumption of 1g/lb of body weight?

I'm 180 right now, which means (according to what I've read) I should be eating about 180g of protein a day.

According to My Fitness Pal, the app I use to track my calories and macros, only 20% of my calories should be coming from protein while 30% of my calories should come from fat, and 50% from carbs. 

The app tells me that about 28oz of chicken meets that protein goal (obviously you can eat other things but for simplicity let's stay with chicken) which comes out to about 840 calories.

The app also says I should be consuming about 1870 calories a day to lose weight (my goal being 160-170).

This means I have about 1000 calories to allocate to my fat and carb macros, which should be 80% of my calories.

What am I doing wrong? Does My Fitness Pal just suck, or am I looking at this the wrong way?

1. What is the purpose of carb loading before/after a workout? If I give my body energy through carbs, wouldn't I be using that energy instead of burning fat? Isn't that the exact opposite of what you want to do? 
2. Why eat complex carbs over simple carbs? I read that simple carbs are processed quickly but how does that translate to fat gained/lost? Is it just energy and insulin that is worried about there and not necessarily actual fitness (as in muscle gained, fat lossed)?
3. On the same vein as question 1, why eat carbs instead of protein? Isn't it better to drink/eat protein so its directly processed for muscle repairs, rather than just burning that energy through carbs? 
4. Why replenish your glycogen through eating before/after a workout whenever you want to lose fat? Isn't the whole point that you deplete glycogen so your body turns to fat for energy? How can you lose fat with glycogen deposits are full?",nutrition,0

p1lfqm,Insane energy levels after cutting dairy?,"Over the past couple years, I’ve experienced chronic fatigue, low energy levels, poor sleep, crazy water bloating, and an inability to seemingly make any progress in the gym or gaining weight. I could eat 3000-4500 calories (I track calories).. and nothing. I could also eat 1000 calories a day and not feel hungry at all. I’ve tried many elimination diets and had nothing work in lessening my symptoms to any extent. 

A couple weeks ago, I decided to cut out all dairy products and my body has nearly done a complete 180. I don’t have trouble sleeping anymore, I don’t have extreme water retention, I get huge muscle pumps in the gym, I actually feel my body getting hungry, and I overall look and feel much better.

I’ve never known myself to be lactose intolerant, and I have no notable symptoms after consuming dairy - other than my stomach basically shutting off. Eating ice cream or drinking milk would make me feel no hunger at all for extended periods of time.

Has anyone experienced anything similar or understand this? Is it possible for dairy products to shut down digestion? I was consuming anywhere from 500-1500 calories a day from protein shakes (whey), milk, cheese, etc. if my body did have some aversion to dairy, would it even digest this stuff, and would it digest other food that I’ve eaten with it?

12oz of Chicken sausage:
36 grams of Fat 
12 grams of Carbs

1 Cup of uncooked white rice 
1 gram of Fat
158 grams of Carbs
13 grams of Protein

2 cups of Chicken Broth
1 gram of Fat

3 gram of Protein 

1 Large onion (150g)
.1 grams of Fat 
14 grams of Carbs

2 Bell Peppers 
.5 grams of Fat 
15 grams of Carbs 
2 grams of protein 

1Tbsp of Oil 
14 gram of Fat
0 gram of Carbs

1. Weigh/measure all the ingredients:
*This is the easiest way to estimate by far. However, it only seems to work for pan-fried or shallow fried food like bacon, chicken breast, etc where moisture loss and oil spatter is negligible*

2. Weighing the food before and after:
*This is the easiest method for things like fried chicken, where measuring before and after takes away the hassle of measuring the flour, egg, oil, etc. but considering the water loss, oil spatter and oil temperture, the calorie range varies a lot and might not be a good estimate*

3. Weigh/measure the oil before and after:
*This is by far the most annoying and tedious method imo. It's also not very good if you fry food that ends up as gunk at the bottom. Not sure how this ranks in terms of accuracy*  


However, none of these can account for the calorie of the food itself from frying; Is that's even possible?

p0484p,One of the reasons people gain too much weight,"I don't know why it took me so many years to figure this out, but now that I have it's quite the eye opener.

One of the reasons why so many people gain too much weight, is because they eat too many high calorie foods that weight the same as low calorie foods.

For example:

1 lb of watermelon weighs the same as 1 lb of chocolate cake. Both of these foods will fill you up the same because they both weigh 1 lb.

But 1 lb of chocolate cake has about 1000 calories. 

1 lb of watermelon has about 140 calories.

So what people need to do, is lower the quantity of high calorie foods they eat and replace it will lower calorie foods that weight the same. This way, they will get just as full, but the meal will be more balanced because they have to go into better food groups in order to get the calories.

It's okay to eat high calorie foods, but the number of calories that you consume from those types of foods should not use up the majority of calories that you should be consuming during an entire day. The calories should be spread out among several food groups, not just one or two.

Once you understand this, you realize that it's okay to have a bacon cheeseburger with fries for lunch, because you know how to use other food groups to get the remaining calories you need for the day.

I found a nice organic, unsweetened brand that contains 1g of sugar per serving. I understand that as far blocking absorption goes, if you aren’t deficient it probably isn’t anything to worry about. My main worry is digestive issues. 

I have no problem with the pre-made cups of oatmeal with added nuts as well as some brands that contain 20g of whey but every time I buy a big box of instant oats I get horribly constipated accompanied by moderate to severe cramping. Not sure if the protein oatmeals come pre-soaked or if possibly the larger portions I make of plain oats are to blame.

Anywho getting to my potentially stupid question: Is oat milk full of phytic acid? Have been drinking a large cup or two a day as well as two cups of coffee with unsweetened oat milk based creamer. I feel like the selenium and b6 give me a small natural boost to testosterone so am considering making my protein shakes with oat milk but if the phytic acid content is pretty high I may cut it out all together.

These stores are built up over their entire lifetime and gets used up during breast feeding.

The authors connect this with the potential healthier and smarter offspring that these women would have due to the abundance of DHA which would make its way to the children via breastfeeding. This may perhaps explain why men find hourglass figures (low waist to hip ratio) attractive. (No mention of what types of fatty acids are stored in breast fat so maybe some one can comment on this).

It’s certainly an interesting theory and one that further validates the importance of omega 3 fatty acids in the diet albeit from a evolutionary perspective. It’s reassuring to see evolutionary research support all the nutritional studies on the benefits of omega 3’s.

I’m now really intrigued as to what the fatty acid composition of visceral stomach fat is and if simple dietary changes would help reduce it. 

Supplements are one way of getting omega 3’s but I genuinely believe food is the best way to obtain all the nutrients that the body needs. Oily fish such as salmon, mackerel and herring are rich sources of DHA.",nutrition,0

A person trying to watch his diet's oxalate levels would probably google which foods are high and low on the stuff, but even to this day, the data is STILL inconsistent. (Aside from a few like Spinach and nuts which are universally agreed on to be loaded with it.) 

For example, broccoli. Here are some sources that say it has low amounts of oxalates:

And some up-to-date sources don't even mention broccoli, this is obviously worse for less popular vegetables. A lot of them aren't included in these so you just have to rely on some website's anecdotal chart.
https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/13/6/1917/pdf

And then there's also the issue that many disagree on whether or not boiling actually affect oxalates at all. Some sources say cooking spinach only reduces the oxalates by a negligible amount, some say up to 30%/80-90% depending on cooking method. Some studies show that cooked spinach actually had more oxalates than raw spinach, I'm so confused. Which sources can I even trust, how do I verify any of this, even new articles cite references from so many different years, sometimes from the 90s or the early 00s instead of the current decade.

Me and my partner would buy sweeteners in bulk just to save a bit of money, these tubs we buy usually have anywhere from 800-1000 sweetener tablets in them and she will go through about 5 or 6 each week. 

I’ve never seen anything like this before and I still can’t believe it - I go around the house to see if she has hidden the sweeteners or set them down somewhere else and just find empty tubs everywhere. 

I have been googling sweetener addictions etc and can’t find anything online other than people who maybe consume about 12 tablets per cup a day which isn’t really to the level my partners mum is consuming them. 

I’m wondering if we should tell a doctor about how many she is going through but it’s just so bizarre I wanted to know anyone else’s thoughts on this situation?

oxaml6,Protein (and fat) utilization in motion,"I ride bikes, and so hang out in cycling-related places and read cycling-related nutrition news from time to time.  Lately I've been wondering about ingested protein while in motion.

For the endurance rider types, taking in water, electrolytes, and carbs (mostly simple sugars) while riding is pretty important to keeping the endurance up (and from experience it absolutely makes a difference).  It's all about keeping glucose levels up and avoiding a ""bonk"".

People who do tours or long distance rides also often eat in the saddle because hunger is pretty natural and you need food in general.  This is often just normal food, eaten from a handlebar bag or something while in motion, so as to avoid having to stop for whatever reason.

But what actually happens to the non-carb macros when they enter the bloodstream while you're still on the go?  Carbs get converted into glucose and provide energy, but what about the protein?  Does muscle, which breaks down a bit under use, repair at all while we're still awake?  Does the protein just get converted into yet more glucose via gluconeogenesis?  Is it just absorbed into various other processes?

Fats as well - do they get used for energy on the go, or do other things need to happen first, like running out of glucose?",nutrition,0

ox3rfz,Nutrient availability in fibrous plant based foods,"There is a lot to read on the nutrient density of plant based foods.  The  other day, I was considering the nutrient availability/absorbability of nutrients in plant based foods.

I'm sure some here have heard of ""anti-nutrients"" found within foods such as legumes, beans, and whole grains.  I've not seen any notable research  myself on the extent that these anti-nutrients affect the net absorption  of minerals and affect overall micronutrient status.

It's still a concern to me, but probably overblown by anti-vegan advocates in particular.   What I haven't seen talked about a lot is the nutrient availability  based on fiber.

Maybe this has no  bearing in reality, but the thought that was going through my head was  that fiber, which is indigestible, contains a non-trivial amount of the  nutrients present within some plant.  for example, 100g of broccoli may  contain  48.2 mg of Vitamin C, but what if half of that is contained in  the indigestible fiber?  Do we not absorb any of it?

Same thing with the nutrients contained in whole grain fibers.  A chemical analysis may show it contains **x**  amount of copper, but how much of that is realistically absorbed?   After all, chemicals break down foods differently than the human  digestive system.  Is there any notable research on this?",nutrition,0

They conclude based on the research that you can use more than 30g protein. But from what I can see that's only for some of it's functions? The proteins are obviously not wasted, it gives energy and amino acids. But MPS can only use 30 grams of protein at once? How does it work. Is the body able to use the extra stored protein to prolong the MPS, even though it's not increased? Or is it already converted and thus the surplus is not optimal for muscle building?

owqunj,Analysis of simultaneous increase in obesity rates and decrease in deaths from heart disease,"In this post, I am going to give my analysis of what seems to be a simultaneous decline in heart disease and increase in the obesity rate. Going to give a disclaimer that I am not a nutritionist or statistician of any kind, but just somebody who glanced over some data briefly and found a connection that seems surprising. That being said, any and all brutal feedback or takedowns of what I am about to argue would be appreciated, because I don't want to spread any misinformation. 

As most of us know, the obesity rate has steadily been increasing throughout the decades. [CDC data (figure 4)](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db360.htm) indicates that in year 2000 the age-adjusted obesity rate was 30.5% for adults, and that by 2018 the rate increased to a staggering 42.4%. In the same span, the severe obesity rate almost doubled, going from 4.7% to 9.2%. In the same span however, [sugar intake has not increased significantly](https://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/data-mine/2014/02/25/surprise-american-sugar-consumption-is-on-the-decline)

A common cause for concern over obesity is its link to heart disease, but somewhat paradoxically, the CDC indicates that heart disease death rates have [declined massively](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6337a6.htm) since the 1980s, decreasing 59.5% for males and 56.8% for females. If obesity is both increasing and associated with heart disease, then why have heart disease death rates fallen off a cliff? **My theory is that the decline in animal fat consumption and the parallel increase in oil intake is responsible for this paradox.** 

Research has [consistently suggested](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32827219/) that reducing saturated fat intake decreases risk of cardiovascular disease. With this in mind, health organizations all over the world have recommended replacing largely saturated animal fats with less saturated plant oils. The [data](http://supplementsos.com/blog/taking-health-advice-to-heart/) suggests that people have heeded this advice, showing a significant decline in lard and butter consumption and a subsequent rise in plant oil consumption. It seems plausible then that this decrease in animal fat intake is at least partially responsible for the mentioned decline in heart disease related deaths. 

If an increase in plant oil and a decrease in animal fat consumption explains why cardiovascular disease has declined, then why have obesity rates increased so much? Linoleic acid could be the answer. Many plant oils commonly found in food and in cooking contain [high levels of linoleic acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linoleic_acid#Dietary_sources). Soybean oil, which is an additive in many processed snacks is 51% linoleic acid. Comparatively, butter, which has seen a massive decline in consumption over the decades is a mere 2%. 

There is some evidence that links linoleic acid consumption with weight gain. A [2016 study on mice](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5235953/) found that mice fed more linoleic acid gained more weight and had greater insulin resistance. A somewhat more compelling study in 2018 found overweight/obese individuals eating a high linoleic acid meal had [higher ghrelin and resistin](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6213143/) levels than a group eating more oleic acids. 

It seems to me that the replacement of animal fats with plant oils may have some relationship with the paradoxical rise in obesity rates and decrease in deaths caused by heart disease. Admittedly, my research is very simplistic in nature, and I did not factor in any advances in medical technology that might explain the above mentioned decrease in death rates.",nutrition,0

owj4ze,Nutritional Advice for bf with arfid (“extreme picky eating”),"My boyfriend has arfid, specifically with fruits and vegetables. Its something that has been a part of him since he was born and it makes it impossible for him to consume basically all plants, except for potatoes, rice, mushrooms, and occasionally some arugula.

&amp;#x200B;

* Impulsive: Individuals with the impulsive style are low on conscientiousness and high on fun-seeking. They often show an attentional bias toward food-related cues, like the smell or sight of tasty foods
* Temptation: This style is related to greater food cravings, overeating, and lack of control.
* Overthinking: This style is a mixture of neuroticism, perfectionism, and behavioral inhibition (e.g., indecision)—traits associated with poor health behaviors and well-being.
* Social: Dieters in this group are high on agreeableness, extraversion, and social closeness. Their love of company and socializing means they are often exposed to many situations, like restaurants and parties, that make it challenging for them to stick to their diets.
* Foodie: Foodies score higher on food appreciation and involvement but lower on having fixed eating times and on selecting foods out of convenience or familiarity.

¿No desayunas huevo por miedo al colesterol?📷

Uno de los mitos más populares es que el huevo aumenta el colesterol y por esta razón no es bueno consumirlo o si se llega a consumir, solo consumir las claras.  
Este mito se originó cuando se asoció al colesterol como causa de las enfermedades cardiovasculares, ya que éste junto con otras sustancias, pueden formar depósitos que bloquean las arterias.  
Sin embargo, los niveles de colesterol en sangre de una persona NO SON CONSECUENCIA DEL CONSUMO DE UN ALIMENTO EN CONCRETO. (En este caso, el huevo), sino de los componentes de la dieta total.

📷Además, existen otros factores: la predisposición genética y la totalidad de grasas saturadas presentes en nuestra alimentación. (las grasas saturadas están presentes en alimentos de origen animal)

Actualmente conocemos que, además de la hipercolesterolemia, son varios los elementos de riesgo que influyen en la presencia de las enfermedades cardiovasculares:  
📷Alcohol  
📷Tabaco  
📷 Sedentarismo  
📷 Estrés  
📷 Obesidad

📷Por lo tanto, el huevo es un alimento, el cual no solo debe tomarse en cuenta su contenido de colesterol, sino también el resto de sus componentes, mismos que nos ayudan a mejorar el estado nutritivo y salud en general.",nutrition,0

osweq3,Should I take protein before or after a workout?,"  

Muscle repair and growth necessitate the use of protein. As a result, many people combine their workouts with the intake of protein supplements in the form of smoothies. The best time to drink a protein shake, on the other hand, is a contentious subject. Should I take [protein before or after a workout](https://yourfitnessgoal.com/protein-before-or-after-a-workout/)? is a most common question among beginners.

Some people feel that a protein shake should be consumed before an exercise, while others believe that it should be consumed afterward.

&amp;#x200B;

**Why does it matter, when I take my protein powder?**

Before deciding whether you should take [protein before or after a workout](https://yourfitnessgoal.com/protein-before-or-after-a-workout/), you should understand that Protein powder consumption relies on your health and fitness goals, as well as your tastes and routine. Certain types of protein are absorbed faster or slower by your body than others, therefore the type of protein and the timing of consumption are linked. Micellar casein, for example, is a slow-digesting protein that is great for folks who drink a protein shake before bed.

Whey proteins, on the other hand, are often fast-absorbing, making them an excellent post-workout option. In conclusion, the time you take your protein has an impact on not just which type of protein is best for you, but also how successful your protein powder is at helping you achieve your individual goals.

**Exercise and protein**

Required Protein is 0.36 grams per pound (0.8 g/kg) of body[ weight ](https://yourfitnessgoal.com/free-100-weight-loss-tips-guide/)in the Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA).

According to a study, those who strength train regularly may require double the RDA, or 0.72 grams per pound (1.6 g/kg), to maintain muscle recovery and growth.

This translates to 109 grams of protein per day for a person weighing 150 pounds (68 kg). It does not matter whether you take[ protein before or after a workout](https://yourfitnessgoal.com/protein-before-or-after-a-workout/), the only thing which matters the most is to take the required protein during a day.

[***People who train regularly needs more protein to recover the muscles at regular interval throughout the day.***](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=People+who+train+regularlyneeds+more+protein+to+recover+the+muscles+at+regular+interval+throughout+theday.&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fyourfitnessgoal.com%2Fprotein-before-or-after-a-workout%2F&amp;via=akkigrov&amp;related=Akkigrov%3AFounder+of+Yourfitnessgoal+%23createyou.)

**Anabolic window**

Many people assume that consuming a protein shake within 30 minutes of doing it out will help them get the most out of their workout.

This 30-minute window, also known as the “anabolic window,” is a brief period during which your muscles act as a protein sponge.

The theory is that if you eat protein outside of the anabolic window, your body won’t be able to use it effectively or build muscle.

This anabolic window of opportunity, according to new research, is significantly longer than 30 minutes and may not be limited to the following exercise.

In reality, when it comes to muscle repair and growth, it may not matter whether you consume a protein shake before or after your workout.

According to new research, consumption of protein is not limited to within 30 minutes after exercise for muscle growth and repair. \[[1](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23360586/)\]

**When to take whey for muscle gain**

You can take whey [protein ](https://yourfitnessgoal.com/protein-before-or-after-a-workout/)anytime during the day to cover your daily protein consumptions. It is not strictly limited to whether you should take[ protein before or after a workout](https://yourfitnessgoal.com/protein-before-or-after-a-workout/). The only goal is to reach your daily protein goal and if you do it regularly then you will see muscle growth throughout time with consistent practice.

Muscle gain does not depends on taking protein at any particular time. However, it will happen if you consume around 2 grams of protein per kg of your body [weight ](https://yourfitnessgoal.com/free-100-weight-loss-tips-guide/)on daily basis.

**Whey Protein before workout vs protein shake after a workout for Weight loss**

[Weight loss](https://yourfitnessgoal.com/free-100-weight-loss-tips-guide/) totally depends on the [caloric deficit diet](https://yourfitnessgoal.com/15-best-zero-calories-food-for-weight-loss/) routine along with meeting daily consumption of protein.

Only one study has investigated the effects of protein consumption on muscular strength and size before and after an exercise.

The researchers divided the 21 men into two groups, each of which got a 25-gram protein shake. The first group received it right before their workout, while the second group received it right after. Everyone went through a full-body workout. \[[2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5214805/%5d)\]

For ten weeks, everyone did a [full-body workout ](https://yourfitnessgoal.com/how-to-get-faster-abs-through-diet-exercise/)three times each week.

Surprisingly, no significant variations in muscle strength or size were discovered across the groups in the study. These findings imply that it doesn’t matter whether you eat[ protein before or after a workout](https://yourfitnessgoal.com/protein-before-or-after-a-workout/) as long as you do so around it.

As a result, you can select the time that is most convenient for you.

**Taking Protein Powder Before Bed**

Sleep is the most crucial routine in your life, other than drinking water. It’s possibly even more necessary than eating because you can go longer without sleep than you can without food.

One of the simplest methods to keep your body refreshed and healthy is to combine adequate sleep with appropriate eating. Because your body is most efficient at healing and rebuilding weary muscles overnight, your bedtime routine is equally as vital as your exercise regimen.

A protein shake, especially one with a slow-digesting protein like micellar casein, will provide your tissues with the nutrition they require throughout their protracted fast.

**How much protein after workout and in daily intake?**

Research has shown that daily required protein consumption anytime during the day is important than the time constraint of whether it should be taken before or after the exercise.

In your daily diet, you should focus on daily protein goals meet as well as calories are taken throughout the day as per your fitness goal whether you are on a gaining or cutting diet.

You can take 2-gram protein per kg of your body [weight ](https://yourfitnessgoal.com/free-100-weight-loss-tips-guide/)each day to gain muscle and for quick recovery.

**Snack Attack**

Snacking for many people is grabbing a bag of chips or other less-than-[healthy foods](https://yourfitnessgoal.com/15-best-zero-calories-food-for-weight-loss/).

Protein powder is a terrific snack replacement that gives you a boost without the added sugar or calories. Make a quick shake for a quick pick-me-up in the middle of the day!

**How to get enough protein**

Protein can be found in both animal and plant-based diets, which can help you satisfy your daily protein requirements. High-quality animal sources of protein include meat, poultry, dairy, and fish.

In the meanwhile, plant-based protein can be found in nuts, beans, legumes, and soy. Animal-based protein appears to be superior to plant-based protein when it comes to muscle growth, although a balance of both is helpful.

Protein smoothies can also be a practical way to boost your protein consumption if you aren’t getting enough from [food ](https://yourfitnessgoal.com/15-best-zero-calories-food-for-weight-loss/)alone.

There are various types of protein powder available in the market but the most widespread and trusted one is whey protein that is easily absorbed by the body and can be used before or after a workout It also has bioactive proteins, which may have additional health advantages.

**Are protein shakes safe for health?**

[Protein shakes](https://yourfitnessgoal.com/protein-before-or-after-a-workout/) are safe to drink for healthy persons. Shakes, on the other hand, are not meant to be used as a meal replacement.

They’re best used in between meals and, if you prefer, throughout workouts. Many people are concerned that combining protein supplements with a high-protein diet would affect their health.

Because high-protein diets have been incorrectly linked to renal illness and osteoporosis, a disease marked by weak and brittle bones, this is the case. In those with healthy kidneys, however, there is no indication that a high-protein diet causes harm.

**Conclusion**

Protein aids in the healing and rebuilding of muscles after exercise, and many people take protein drinks after their workouts to help with this.

However, studies show that whether you drink a[protein shake before](https://yourfitnessgoal.com/protein-before-or-after-a-workout/) or [after your workout](https://yourfitnessgoal.com/protein-before-or-after-a-workout/)makes no difference. Surprisingly, your total daily protein intake is the most important factor.

While protein smoothies can be beneficial before and after exercises and in between meals, make sure you consume enough protein throughout the day.

Both [foods ](https://yourfitnessgoal.com/15-best-zero-calories-food-for-weight-loss/)and supplements can assist you in achieving your objectives.",nutrition,0

One article stated that besides being used for the conversion into EPA and DHA ALA has no function and is stored or used as energy within the body. Am I wrong for thinking that ALA is pretty much of almost no importance to the body?  
2. If ALA has no other function and if a person gets enough of DHA and EPA, either through food or supplements, isn't it then pretty much unnecessary to try reach the daily AI? Most ALA sources are plant based which means trying to reach the daily AI leads to a higher intake of omega 6 oils which most people are already getting more than enough from through their diet.

oshc4n,Quality Dental Care With Invisalign," 

Quality Dental Care is a leading dental care organization in the United States. Founded in 1968, Quality Dental Care uses more than ten dental specialists and full dentists. It focuses on general orthodontics, cosmetic dentistry and porcelain veneers. The center's main dental services include dental implants and whitening. In addition to these services, they also focus on post-graduate dental education.

At [**Quality Dental Care**](https://mydentalplan.in/), there are some general dentists and specialty doctors who provide services for individuals, families and students at the centers. These dentists provide services such as tooth extractions, root canal treatments, bridges and crowns, tooth fillings and crowns, teeth cleaning, porcelain veneers, bleaching and bonding, ceramic crowns, teeth whitening, veneers, gums and fillings, bridges and crowns, orthodontic services, sedation dentistry and cosmetic dentist services. They also offer some emergency care such as emergency tooth extraction, emergency tooth removal, and emergency cosmetic dentist services.

Dental Assistants (DA) at Quality Dental Care provide care that ranges from aiding patients with their dentures, to assisting general dentists with various procedures and treatments, to helping those with general dental care issues. Their main focus is on improving the quality of patients' oral health through a variety of preventative measures and interventions. DA's perform basic patient care functions such as taking and developing x-rays, preparing patients for dental treatments and transporting them to and from treatment appointments. They can also perform laboratory and clinical examinations, help make appointments and arrange insurance claims.

[**Quality Dental Care**](https://mydentalplan.in/) provides several different programs for the whole family. The ""Orlando"" program targets families with children ages three to eleven years old and ""Bay Shore"" program targets adults who are fifty years old and up. Both programs target populations that traditionally have had low incomes but that has risen above the economic circumstances that once kept them poor. Both programs aim to help give every family access to quality dental care and cosmetic dental services that will ensure they have healthy teeth and a smile that everyone can appreciate.

A good quality dental care plan offers more than mere tooth-whitening techniques such as porcelain veneers or teeth whitening. Cosmetic dentistry can take an active role in the way you look by offering treatments such as Botox injections, Invisalign aligners, Inman aligners, teeth whitening, laser whitening, dental bridges and crowns, and even cosmetic metal braces. Metal braces are no longer the domain of sports teams or movie stars. Professional cosmetic dentists in Orlando and Bay Shore are now able to offer all of these treatments, as well as the traditional metal braces. For teens and adults, a smile is an important part of good self-esteem and confidence, and cosmetic dentists can help you achieve the ideal smile for your face, your body, and your budget.

Many individuals may not consider Invisalign as a treatment option when considering cosmetic dentistry, but the truth is that this type of brace has transformed lives. Those who have undergone Invisalign treatment have reported improved posture, better health and confidence, and an improved quality of life. Cosmetic dentists can also help patients who need additional treatment due to their teeth's weaknesses such as chipped or broken teeth, chips, and cracks. Some insurance companies cover the costs of Invisalign if the patient agrees to pay for the entire procedure in advance, while other plans require payment upfront for the full cost of the treatment.",nutrition,0

This is my desperate cry for help. I have literally spent nights contemplating suicide because of how absolutely helpless and overwhelmed I feel and how everyone always says “Keep fighting, hang in there, be strong, just keep looking” while also never been able to provide any help.

I’m writing this because I’m at the absolutely end of my rope, and I don’t know where else to turn. I have spent months searching, first in-person looking for dietitians/nutritionists in my current country of residence, Thailand, and then online through every website I could think of from google searches to upwork to high-profile “TeleHealth” companies that focus on nutrition such as Anderson Nutrition, Amwell, and Telehealth. None of these websites will treat me as I’m not an American citizen in America.

I’m in my late 20’s, and I have suffered from constipation and diarrhea my entire life. When I was younger a doctor in my home country (Canada) told me I was celiac after doing a blood test. I was gluten free for about 7 years until recently when my symptoms became really bad that I couldn’t handle it, and so I went for a plethora of testing. This time I had blood and biopsy tests done, both endoscopy and colonoscopy and the doctors say I am NOT celiac. Besides some precancerous polyps found and removed in my colon, the doctors say there is nothing wrong with me, so perhaps I have IBS/IBD. If IBS, their running diagnosis is IBS-Mixed or IBS-Constipation with overflow diarrhea.

The point is, I have tried every possible drug and procedure for treatment. None give me a quality of life I am happy with, as they generally just trade one symptom’s decrease for another’s increase. I want to try treatment using diet, but it is a complicated process and one that I don’t have the mental capacity to do alone. I have been told by a dozen doctors what I need to do, but none of them are apparently able to actually help me do it.

I have an autoimmune disorder, vitiligo, so I have been told that I should do an elimination diet that combines both AIP (Auto immune protocol) and FODMAP diets, followed by a reintroduction/challenge phase that tests each ingredient one-by-one. It is important as well to note that these diets make it difficult to attain all nutritional needs and so this is something that should be considered when meal planning. I CAN’T. I can’t do this. I shutdown and get so overwhelmed I just want to scream and cry. It’s debilitating. I don’t know anything about nutrition. I am dealing with things like completing a bachelor’s degree and physiotherapy and trying to manage all this just makes we want to give up.

I want to pay someone who knows and is studied and practiced in the nutritionist/dietitian area of expertise to make me recipes that comprise a 7-day/week meal plan that covers the entire elimination phase, and then will follow up with me to see how I’m doing as needed, and then alter the recipes/meal plan throughout the entire challenge/reintroduction phase over the course of however many months is necessary. I am committed to the grocery shopping, and the cooking, because those are monumental tasks to me in my life, but things I feel I can do. The logistics behind everything else, I want a doctor/expert. I NEED someone who is trained. I can’t do this alone, and I feel like just throwing myself off a building whenever I hear someone say “Hang in there, you can do it.” No, I can’t do it. Someone please let me fucking pay you to help me because I’m telling you I CAN’T DO IT ALONE.

This post is broadly impersonal, dealing with the topic of nutrition/supplementation for joint health but I want to open with a little context for my inquiry.

I’ve grown up an athlete and have gotten into hybrid training after leaving traditional sports behind. My hybrid training is a mix of cardio (primarily running but also cycling) and strength training.

Given this kind of training, I’ve started to experience some discomfort in my knees and ankles— more the former than the latter. Part of this problem is likely due to the fact that the demands of my current program are greater than what my body has been accustomed to. Part of it is likely due to imperfect running technique. While I work to acclimatize to the program and improve my running form (among other things like improving flexibility, etc), I’d like to know if there are some supplements the nutrition community might recommend.

I keep coming across collagen, msm, glucosamine, chondroitin, fish/krill/algae oil, and turmeric.

Is there any scientific consensus as to which supplements are likely to best address joint pain? Ideally, I’m looking for more than an anti-inflammatory bandaid. Ideally, I’m looking for holistic joint health— like maintaining synovial fluid, for instance.

Aside from the science concerning the ingredients/compounds listed above, are there any particular brands/products you can recommend as offering science-backed  remedies?

oredk7,Pro red meat papers in 2021,"“The majority of studies, and especially the higher quality studies, showed that those who avoided meat consumption had significantly higher rates or risk of depression, anxiety, and/or self-harm behaviors. There was mixed evidence for temporal relations, but study designs and a lack of rigor precluded inferences of causal relations. Our study does not support meat avoidance as a strategy to benefit psychological health.” [1] (2021)

A couple of such review papers have recently been popping up favoring aspects of meat consumption vs vegetarianism. 
 
A more polemic read citing the above paper as well as calling out on public policy supporting plant and mass agriculture and links to poverty is [2], by a researcher.

A 2020 paper states a number of contradicting studies, leaning more towards meat eating [3].

Granted, these are not the most reliable sources, specially [2], yet they do review a considerable ammount of studies and have convincing arguments. Any criticisms?

Next I tried 18 grams and using 10% that would come out to be 720mg of sodium. This time the rotini tasted much better because of the sodium I could clearly taste.

Background: I don’t have high cholesterol, but adopted a plant based diet last year in an effort to be healthier.

First test: July 2020.
Cholesterol: 192
HDL: 50
LDL: 120

Second Test: July 2021
Cholesterol: 165
HDL: 45
LDL: 88

Before the first test, I had been eating a diet pretty heavy in meat. Little red meat, but lots of chicken, fish, dairy, etc. fiber intake was probably lower veggie intake probably low as well.

In September 2020 I decided to try a full vegan diet while also keeping added oils to a minimum. Successfully kept this up for about 6 months, but decided to reintroduce fish, a little eggs, and a very small amount of dairy a few days a week. Still no poultry or red meat.

I know nutrition is super important to actually see the results you’re working for in the gym so I’m wondering if anyone has a (online) course in nutrition they could recommend or even just books (if a course isn’t really worth it).

olerq6,Why is taking a lot of supplements seen as bad for your liver and kidneys?,"I am here to learn why is this the case? Below are some of my reasons as to why it’s not the case, but I would like to learn from others perspective. I don’t mean steroids or prescription strength stuff; I mean ordinary over the counter supplements for health optimization. Capsules, tablets, even powders. Some of which are even just herbs, e.g. curcumin, garlic, ashwagandha, ginger in capsules. 

For example whey protein, people say it causes stress on the kidneys therefore it will damage the kidneys in the long run. However, the kidneys are “stress” because they need to filter out all the urea nitrogen (the waste product made from breaking down protein in the liver) that is leftover from utilizing the protein. However, this happens as well if someone eats a high protein diet with say 500g of protein from only whole foods (e.g. steamed chicken, or from rice and beans, or any other source); either way the protein is still going to leave the kidneys to filter out the urea nitrogen, which increases the filtration rate and causing stress on them. With that said, drinking a protein shake doesn’t cause any more damage compared to whole foods if the daily protein intake is normal. 

Many people in the population has hypertension (and even just acute high blood pressure from an intense workout) arguably causes more damage to the kidneys than supplements will, let alone a lot of supplements has side benefits of helping with slightly lowering ones blood pressure; “but no, these supplements are going to damage the kidneys”. I don’t understand why this is the case...

When someone gets multiple containers of pump supplements: like beta-alanine, citrulline malate, caffeine, creatine, etc., to make ones own preworkout drink instead of just buying a container of preworkout that has a “proprietary blend” of all that exact ingredients included with extra superfluous compounds (which is more expensive than making ones own preworkout in the long run), isn’t that just the same thing?? But it’s seen as a negative thing because people would say “oh no this guy has too many supplements”. This can be said for multivitamins too (not getting into the absorption debate here). 

I know there is a huge range of what is considered supplements, and not all of them are beneficial without side effects. So please don’t get pedantic. I’m talking generally here and the examples I use are broad enough examples that a good number of people can relate to as well. 

Let’s say for a natural gym junky that makes use of OTC supplements for bodybuilding, and also takes supplements to prevent hepatotoxicity (like NAC, milk thistle, TUDCA) and nephrotoxicity (like astragalus). Somehow it is still seen as bad because of the amount of supplements, when chances are that person’s liver and kidneys are healthier than the average guy that goes socializing in the bar some nights every week or gets a refillable cup for the soda machine every time eating out; but it isn’t perceived as that’s the case. 

I know there are dietitians in this sub that may be more knowledgeable than me or can add another point or two. Can someone explain why do people say taking multiple supplements is bad for the liver or kidneys? 


TLDR I don’t think taking more than just a few supplements (or more) is bad for ones kidneys and liver, would love to hear an opposite point of view. 



Edit: I know someone is going to comment “eat your garlic and ginger as whole food instead of taking capsules of that”. If one doesn’t eat a good amount of those from their meals everyday, next best thing to get the benefits is to get it from supplements; it’s the same plus supplements are cheaper when looked at the ratio of price to amount of said compound in the herb that’s intended to yield the benefits of the particular herb, and also tested for purity. 

By the way, please don’t say that one does not need to supplement if they’re having a good diet; that is not the topic here. Also, please don’t say that if you rely on coffee to start your day.",nutrition,0

Also, does the milling process destroy nutrients? I only want it for the clean source of carbs/calories but it would be nice to get the nutritional benefits of sweet potato as well.

Part of a shake would not be a problem though. Cooking entire sweet potatoes and putting them in a shake would be far too much volume.

I am curious to learn from other experts and knowledgable people such as yourself on the relationship between different nutrients and great food ratios if you know of them, and why you think they are important to consider.

One time an ex and I were fooling around in the shower after a long night of drinking. (Don't worry this relates to nutrition lol) Well their shower drain was very slow so we had water up to our ankles.
     They got really sick and threw up several times in the tub and it was obvious they had eaten fried chicken earlier because there were literal bite sized chunks everywhere. Whole pieces of chicken with skin on gratuitously floating in our ankle water. I had to console him while I used my fingys as sifters to scoop the poorly chewed and digested chicken chunks out of the ankle water so it would drain.
     Anyway, I stumbled across a great way to check how well you are chewing today. Eat a whole carrot. If it hurts going down at first you'll know you've been chewing wrong.

I was curious about the effects of Effervescent tablets (Vitamins, Magnesium, Calcium etc.). Since they are so cheap and supposedly cover 100% of the body's need. I was looking through the internet and the general finding seems that they are almost never necessary, useless, sometimes even dangerous.  
I know about the Sodium they use, and that it's unhealthy. Furthermore, I also know for example the Calcium in most of these tablets can't even be properly processed by a human body.

  
I still disliked the overly negative nature of most articles I found, since they debunk ridiculous claims like ""Supplementary xxx will prolong life"". Obviously that's not true. I was just wondering is there ANY positive thing about them? Do they work, at least to some extent, in some cases?

oh482z,Is sauerkraut a possible carcinogen?,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suan_cai#Possible_health_hazards_of_pickled_vegetables says about suan cai

&gt; The World Health Organization has listed pickled vegetables as a possible carcinogen, and the British Journal of Cancer released an online 2009 meta-analysis of research on pickles as increasing the risks of esophageal cancer. The report, citing limited data in a statistical meta analysis, indicates a potential two-fold increased risk of oesophageal cancer associated with Asian pickled vegetable consumption. Results from the research are described as having ""high heterogeneity"" and the study said that further well-designed prospective studies were warranted.[2] However, their results stated ""The majority of subgroup analyses showed a statistically significant association between consuming pickled vegetables and Oesophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma"".[2]

&gt; The 2009 meta-analysis reported heavy infestation of pickled vegetables with fungi. Some common fungi can facilitate the formation of N-nitroso compounds, which are strong oesophageal carcinogens in several animal models.[3] Roussin red methyl ester,[4] a non-alkylating nitroso compound with tumour-promoting effect in vitro, was identified in pickles from Linxian in much higher concentrations than in samples from low-incidence areas. Fumonisin mycotoxins have been shown to cause liver and kidney tumours in rodents.

&gt; A 2017 study in Chinese Journal of Cancer has linked salted vegetables (common among Chinese cuisine) to a 4-fold increase in nasopharynx cancer, where fermentation was a critical step in creating nitrosamines, which some are confirmed carcinogens, as well as activation of Epstein–Barr virus by fermentation products.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauerkraut#Disadvantages says about sauerkraut

&gt; Excessive consumption of sauerkraut may lead to bloating and flatulence due to the trisaccharide raffinose, which the human small intestine cannot break down. This does not negatively affect long-term health, although it might be uncomfortable.[40] Additionally, sauerkraut has a very high content of sodium.

Does sauerkraut have the same advantages as suan cai does?
(as a possible carcinogen, infested with  fungi  which can facilitate the formation of N-nitroso compounds, creating nitrosamines, ...)

And now after months of hard work my  inches) I decided that I need to change something and for the first time in my life I started tracking calories and macros and I discovered that I was from 1000-1400 calories a day while still being really active, probably 10k+ steps, a lot of outdoor activity (cycling, swimming in the river, playing sports and being on my feet all day, I sat only when I was eating and sleeping and sometimes throughout the day), and I was working out in the gym 3 times a week and doing really intense Stairmaster sessions 3 to 4 times a week. I decided that I first start eating 2000 calories a day and tomorrow morning I will weigh myself again. I researched BMR and TDEE calculators and they overjoyed that my TDEE while being SLIGHTLY active is 2092 calories and in order to gain 0.25 kg per week I should eat 2400 calories which is a 300 calorie surplus. Now I am still very active and being outside a lot, but for at least 2 more weeks I won't be allowed to workout a lot maybe 20 min 3 times a week. So I am just asking for your opinions and advices for me. I really would want to gain weight but not a lot of fat. I am so frightened because I have an appointment in the hospital 7 days from now and  I do not know what would be best for me. I was also considering gaining 0.5kg per week, but that would according to all  the calculators require 2663 calories a 551 calorie surplus while being slightly active which I am not (I am on my feet all day, I swim, cycle, walk a lot, workout sometimes and am always doing something)  I am really thankful for all your answers and you all will help me  a lot.

However, each bottle contains around 20 grams of sugar. This puts the daily intake of sugar above 100 grams. Also, each bottle contains around 16 grams of protein, which is has a percent DV of 32%. Drinking 5 to 6 bottles would make the protein intake in a day way beyond the percent DV. Other vitamins/ingredients will also exceed the percent DV.

I don't see this as healthy in any way, so why do doctors recommend Ensure to people with problems swallowing, digestive issues, etc? Also, are there health complications of taking in vitamins, protein, etc, more than than the percent DV? Will consuming 100+ grams of sugar cause any health problems?",nutrition,0

For instance, last night before dinner I was at 83; 1 hour later 85; 2 hours later 113; 3 hours later 103.

This morning, my fasting blood sugar was 91. After Breakfast (2 eggs &amp; homemade oatmeal with coconut oil):
1 hr: 86
1.5 hr: 93
2 hr: 98, so in that case it actually dropped a bit and then rose later.

Sometimes I’ll have some other protein instead of the turkey sandwich such as chicken. 

My primary goal is weight loss and this diet is temporary until I reach my target weight, but I don’t want it to be at the expense of my health.

When I look at menus online, at least the ones that disclose nutritional information, you can often filter by dietary preferences. Keto, vegetarian, vegan, vegetarian, etc. but never low-fat. Maybe because then there'd be no options for anything that comes from a food source outside of your own house?

We avoid the bun on burgers, the shell on tacos, the sugar in drinks, and make so many other modifications in pursuit of being healthy, while slowly our arteries harden and sometimes there's no warning until it's too late.

oebs5v,6 Steps I Used To Lose Weight,"I am not perfect in any way. These are just a few of the things I focused on to lose weight. Take what you want, leave what you don’t.

&amp;#x200B;

\#1 - Internal Motivation:

I had to find something deep within myself to keep me motivated. Surface-level things weren’t cutting it. I had to peel back the layers, like an onion, to discover my TRUE MOTIVATION. Once I knew what that was, I was focused, disciplined, and on a mission to succeed.

&amp;#x200B;

\#2 - My Macros:

I learned quickly that not every nutrition plan is going to work for everybody. Cookiecutter plans don’t take into account your body’s unique makeup and personal needs. It took me a while, but I did learn how to determine my resting metabolic rate based on my weight and body fat percentage. From there, I was able to customize my macronutrients for weight loss. I highly recommend learning this process. I’ll tell you why in step #5.

&amp;#x200B;

\#3 Key Essential Nutrients:

After doing some more reading and research, I learned that our bodies need certain vital nutrients for healthy weight loss, and most of us don’t get enough of them (Vitamins, Minerals, Fiber, Water, Healthy Fats). After completing step #2 and looking at what I was eating, I realized I needed to fill in the gaps with a few supplements to get everything my body needed — getting the nutrients I was missing made a HUGE difference in my results. I started having more physical and mental energy, my digestion started improving, the time I needed to recover between workouts began to decrease, and my weight loss started to go much faster.

&amp;#x200B;

\#4 Exercise:

Exercise for me was so difficult. Not because it was hard, but because I was so embarrassed and felt so out of place going into a gym (I got bulled one time for being the “fat guy” on the treadmill). SO… I had to make exercise enjoyable and comfortable. I started with at-home activities from YouTube. Then I found some awesome exercise video games. My main focus was to do my best for 30-45 minutes a day. Now that I've lost the weight, I'm enjoying Crossfit!

 

 \#5 Breaking Plateaus:

As your body changes, what worked 10, 8, 6, 4, or even 2 weeks might not work today. That is why it is so important to learn how to calculate your resting metabolic rate and calculate your macros. Those numbers will change as your body changes. If my weight or my body fat percentage weight down, I did not worry about this. When BOTH my weight and body fat percentage plateaued, I would re-evaluate my numbers and make changes.

&amp;#x200B;

\#6 Find a coach who can teach you, not do for you:

After lots and lots of coaches and trainers telling me what to do, I got results, but I always relied on them, and I didn't want to have to be paying someone constantly. I eventually found a coach who took the time to TEACH ME how to do all this (KNOWLEDGE IS PRICELESS). Now, I can do it independently and don’t need to pay others to figure all of this out for me. I’m in control and know what to do to get the results I want to get, and I have!

 

 I hope this helps! And again, take what you want, leave what you don't.",nutrition,0

900-950 calories per day from candy is no bueno, i imagine.

I avoid this as much as possible. However, I don't believe that fruit juice not from concentrate has no added sugar. But that's for another discussion. 

Now I've been doing some googling regarding the natural sugar in homemade fruit smoothies and the natural sugar found in whole fruits. It appears that this sugar is not the same because of the way the body absorbs it. From my google searches, it appears that in liquid form (still natural, no added sugar), the body absorbs the natural fruit sugar at a much higher, quicker rate which means that it has a more negative impact on the body and should be counted toward daily recommended sugar intake. Is this info correct? If so, this is news to me. 

I do know that the natural sugar found in whole fruits is not counted toward the recommended daily sugar intake. What I do not know is if the natural sugar found in fruits in homemade smoothies is counted toward the recommended daily sugar intake. The info that I've found by googling appears inconclusive, so I coming here to ask. 

Things I do know: 

-fruit smoothies provide less satiety compared to whole fruits, so people just need to watch how much they're actually consuming 

-for fibre intake, sometimes homemade fruit smoothies can be better because of the way the body absorbs the fibre. In liquid form as opposed to whole fruit fibre",nutrition,0

As the title suggests, I'm looking for ideas for healthy snacks and foods that will help with weight loss. I know raw veggies are great, so I'm set there, but I'd like other options. I've read a lot of conflicting information about fruits, especially when it comes to weight loss. If I understand correctly, nuts are good for you, but if you eat too many of them then they can cause you to gain weight? The internet conflicts itself and I'm not sure what is right 

Any other foods that jump to mind? 

Or, any site in particular you trust to give you accurate information about food?

Would prefer answers from an industry professional like a registered dietitian. Please state if you are one or if you just are a nutrition connoisseur - I'll hear you out too especially if you can confidently say you know where your gaps are / don't pretend that you know everything. 

I just did quite a bit of bloodwork and a urinalysis everything is good. B12, iron, cal, mag, sodium, potassium, thyroid, lipids, and more all good.
 I am on a plant based diet and have been for almost 4 years so that was reassuring. However , I'm concerned that my doctor is missing some things or if there's some things that can't be measured - primarily because of my knowledge of how little nutrition education GPs go through in school.

My main concerns - 

-  I was told Omega 3s can't be measured unless I'm in a hospital.  However we did do my lipids/cholesterol overall and I was perfectly fine. ( Might be an Ontario, Candace thing) 

- iodine

- collagen

- specific amino acids like l-glutamine 

- need for pro/pre biotics 

- zinc 

- b vitamins 

- creatine ( though as I'm losing hair and creatine is linked to hair loss , I'm too scared to take creatine ) 

I already have tracked everything through cronometer, but it doesn't track all of those or tell me the absolute full nutrition profile of everything - or whether I'm absorbing it - or sometimes it does look like I'm a little low in something but it might also be misleading - like it usually tells me I'm low on potassium but potassium in my bloodwork was fine. 


What should I do ? I'm aware that I can take supplements for all, but I'd rather not if I don't have to due to the cost, inconvenience etc. So, thoughts? I really want to settle this area of my life once and for all and I need some help. I'm sick and tired of being concerned about whether my nutrition is too low or high.",nutrition,0

Specifically, I’ve really valued:
- the simplification of nutritional info with a points system
- the automatic adjustment of my points allotment depending on my current progress to goal
- the ease with which I could log foods
- the existence of “zero point” food categories that allowed me to make easy and smart food decisions

I also exercise most days so I would imagine it would be helpful to incorporate those stats into the program.

o9kr1t,Psyllium husk fiber and LDL,"**First, a PSA:** I was looking at the scientific literature on psyllium husk fiber supplementation and LDL cholesterol, and the effect size is bonkers large. I can't believe that we aren't shouting from the hills about this. For example, if you read this meta-analysis, the effect is dose-dependent and the estimated effect size is in a range that can have a highly potent impact on reducing cardiovascular risk. [https://www.nature.com/articles/ejcn200849](https://www.nature.com/articles/ejcn200849)

Quote from the discussion, suggesting that even these estimated effects are likely underestimating the true effect of this: "" We believed that the results of this meta-analysis represented a conservative estimate of psyllium effect on lipid-lowering. We could conclude that there was a publication bias in this meta-analysis, based on the results of funnel plots. The publication bias was mainly caused by ‘large effect but small trial’ phenomenon. The effect size would be larger if all those small trials were published and selected into the meta-analysis. "" 

I for one would MUCH rather down a tablespoon of psyllium husk fiber each day, as unpleasant as that is, compared to taking statins with their side effects.

**Second, a question:** Any experts here know whether I could potentially enhance the effect of psyllium by dose timing? Like, is there reason to suspect that taking it just before or after a meal could be maximally beneficial? Or right before bed or after waking up? I can't find a good reference for this and I don't really understand the mechanism by which it works to lower LDL.",nutrition,0

So I don‘t really understand the guidelines for the recommended daily-intake of omega 3´s and wondered if someone could shed light on this.

I read: the recommended intake of Alpha-Linolenacid (the Omega 3 in Most plant sources) is 1,3g, but this gets transformed in the body to EPA and DHA. But the „conversion rate“ of the body is not so high. And the daily recommendation of DHA and EPA is around 250-300mg.

I take algae-supplements and they have 585mg total Omega3s of which DHA are 340 and EPA are 200mg.

It’s about a third of the recommended daily intake when you take the total omega 3, but it has so much „straight available“ DHA and EPA. So could you say it covers the daily need or not? 

I think it´s a bit weird because just a tablespoon of hemp- or rapeseed-Oil covers the need „total omega 3 wise“ - kinda weird when a omega 3 supplement does not.

Or is both, so DHA/EPA and Alpha-Linolenacid equally important/you have to see it as different nutrients with different daily recommandations or could the body theoretically function perfectly if it never had Alpha-Linolenacid and only direct DHA/EPA through algae/supplements/fish?

For instance, would eating these things definitely (physically and medically) increase your estrogen receptivity/production levels, even going so far as to stunt growth in adolescents, and give high estrogen symptoms such as enlarged breasts, or does it simply not physiologically work that way, (or perhaps is it not a big of a deal?).

I have heard a myriad of differing opinions, both ""empirically"" (the studies were not conclusive but still concerning) and hearsay wise, (here are some literal examples: Eating animal products and/or phytoestrogenic plants will make you short, eating animal products and/or phytoestrogenic plants will make you tall, phytoestrogens and animal products increase estrogen, phytoestrogens and animal products decrease estrogen )-

\- I honestly feel utterly insane at this point. Its all contradictory, lending credence to the idea that this is a very misinformed and not well understood topic, but perhaps I am just looking in the wrong places.

Hence why I am asking you guys, as I'm entirely lost and worried.

\---

If you think they *do* concernedly increase an individuals estrogen, and thence that the estrogen/phytoestrogens within food are genuine physical concerns, I have a few questions, (if you think they *don't*, then just focus on explaining the main question asked above):

\-Does getting fat free variants remove it? Considering estrogen is a fat soluble hormone and all? Or are estrogen/and estrogen-like compounds just ingrained within all of the animal products macronutrients (Proteins/carbs), and not just fat?

\-In most of the (albeit questionable) studies, the estrogen levels are measured through urine. But wouldn't that just show that the excess estrogen is excreted, and not used? Like, doesn't your endocrine system naturally suffice your bodily need for estrogen, and so any excess estrogen consumed via external sources (food) is just ignored and therefore not used? Or am I failing to understand bodily functions?

\-Is this increase actually big enough to have detrimental effects? Or is it at more of a non-potent, residual level, unable to cause things like overactive estrogen receptors, stunted growth, enlarged breasts, lack of libido and so forth, especially in a healthy and active, low BF % individual?

I quit refined carbs other then white rice and all added sugar about 1 week ago, I did not always consume sugar I was very healthy fasting exercise etc till about 1.5 years ago when I got very busy with work and life and ended up tanking my health a bit as I started to notice acne sleep issues and getting tried after eating.

I've had all blood work done from fasting insulin to crp and glucose everything was perfect except my free cortisol was elevated but I kinda attributed that to stopping sugar and starting fasting as the symptoms im about to list started the next day that I cut out added sugar which I consumed lots of.

Symptoms. 
Depression physical 
Headaches 
Pins needles all over body not painful more annoying
Extreme fatigue 
Body burning up usually at night
Extreme thirst
No appetite
Vivid dreams
Resting heart rate was usually about 50bpm now its around 62 to 65

To clarify the no appetite and fatigue depression were the first symtpoms.  This all started when I cut out sugar and it's been about 2 weeks, end of first week I dipped into sugar just to see if it would go away and I did get temporary relief but felt terrible after.

o7svui,Do your muscles still utilize protein if glycogen depleted?,"This is what I think I understand...although please correct me if I'm wrong:

  
Muscle glycogen is primarily utilized when we...well, use our muscles in exercise. And, it's important because if muscle glycogen is depleted, then instead of using the glycogen for the exercise, our muscles will instead break down the muscle itself to power its movements. This is especially true for weightlifting or high intensity stuff, and less true for low intensity exercise.

  
However, I'm a little confused on why carbohydrates are so important AFTER a workout. Let's say you depleted your glycogen stores in the muscle a bit, but you're not working out for the next 24 hours. By then, you'll probably have had enough food for glycogen stores to be refilled to power your next workout, even if you don't consume carbohydrates immediately after your first workout.

  
So why is it that carbohydrates are recommended immediately following a workout? If you were just to sit down after that workout and not do anything (so even though your muscle glycogen is depleted you're not using your muscles anymore), but you ingested pure protein, would it still be absorbed into your muscles? Do your muscles for some reason need to be immediately full of glycogen to absorb amino-acids and rebuild?

The shows aim was to try to highlight the benefit of canned food and kept coning back to cost and less sugar, more convenient etc.

This show did not have a clear conversation on the nutrional merits of fresh soup. I make soup at home regularly so I know its health than fresh soup bought in a shop as there are no sweeteners, herbs or even lemon juice instead of salt and additives and a low dairy content if I chose to add cream.... but by the fact I'm stir frying then boiling the veg, is it still nutritious from a vitamin and mineral point of view?

Regardless, I feel so much of nutritional science is REACTIVE to the problem of obesity.  Whether something is healthy is only considered in the context of if it makes you gain weight.  I feel this is completely distorting and destroying people's perception of nutrition.

A plan/diet/food isn't less healthy because it does things that increase the storage of fat.  That part is completely normal.  Storing fat is good for a healthy person.  But, so many of these ""experts"" preach everything's virtue in terms of how much it helps you lose weight.

Sawdust according to them would be healthy because it makes you lose weight.  Cigarettes and Cocaine would also be relatively healthy lol.  Nowhere is preventing disease, cancer, aging really a focus anymore.  It's all about weight.  I feel it's promoting these diets/fads/nutritional ""facts"" that are confusing to people.

To be clear... obesity isn't an inherent problem.  It's one we have in society due to processed foods largely.  Even if you're not active, if you eat real food most people won't become obese.  The problem is processed foods.  And, rather than simply saying ""don't eat processed foods and you won't be fat"", nutritionists focus on shortcuts, hacks, and silly diets to make you lose weight while eating processed foods.

If you cut out processed/fake foods, losing weight is no longer a concern.  At that point being HEALTHY is the concern... a goal that is often lost on mainstream nutritional science.

o6xh9q,3 Effective And Natural Ways To Boost Immunity,"The first step in your immunity-building journey should be to adapt to some natural ways that would help increase immunity. There are multiple ways to make our bodies intelligent enough to work on their functioning through these natural immune system boosters. 

**Sleep Enough**

One of the most important ways to take care of our body is something which we all have been taking for granted due to a busy lifestyle and that is our BEAUTY SLEEP!  

Sleeping enough is the best panacea that helps increase immunity naturally. Have you ever noticed how we all are asked to sleep more when we are sick? That is because sleep works on boosting our immunity and gives us the much-needed rest for making treatments successful. 

**Proper Nutrition Intake**

How to increase immunity power in body naturally? Well, another one of the most effective and natural ways to boost immunity is proper nutrition. As we all know that food is the first necessity for living beings to survive, so is checking what we eat. Food can either build our immunity or destroy it, depending on our eating habits… 

If you keep eating junk all the time, you are likely to suffer from diseases often as they lack nutrients, so our body is just getting some empty calories without nourishment and unhealthy weight gain, which can even lead to some severe lifestyle disorders in the future. So, make sure to keep your sugar intake and junk food within the limit.  

**Exercise Regularly**

Our human body is meant to move and stay active as much as possible. We all are designed for movement and not to live a sedentary lifestyle. Working out promotes better blood circulation, increases power and stamina, reduces inflammation, and promote healthy turnover of immune cells.

However, there is no known benefit of pseudovitamin B12 to us humans, which is the B12 found in plant sources. Does pseudovitamin B12 use the same B12 receptor cites in our cells, therefore not allowing us to absorb the real B12 hence causing functional B12 deficiency? I’m trying to find out if pseudovitamin B12 just benign and useless, or does it actually have negative effects. From what I know, our bodies don’t know the difference between the two. 

Something like spirulina has high amounts of pseudovitamin B12. Should we take b12 supplement before taking spirulina later in the day, so that the actual B12 binds to the receptors before the pseadovitamin B12 can. Would that help or no?

Other than spirulina, I heard that other food like Kombucha, fermented soy, pickled vegetables, sauerkraut, most seaweed like nori, kelp, kombu etc. have high amounts of pseudovitamin B12.

o6mh8w,"Beans: To soak, or not to soak,","That is the question:

All packages I have read, the instructions recommend soaking for six to eight hours before cooking or at least a quick soak which is brining the pot of water to a boil and then turning it off and letting it sit there for a couple of hours as I recall.

So what really is the purpose?  Some claim the cooking time is reduced, but it is negligible to me all things considered.

Others claim like sprouting your beans, that you are awakening them and they will be more nutritious.  They do not sprout, but the process of rejuvenation has at least started.  The beans begin to draw in the liquid and not be so swiveled as well.

They also say soaking and then dumping the water, some say two or more times through out the day helps to reduce gas or bloating.  But if worried about nutrition, a lot of the color goes down the drain as well, depending on the bean.  Isn't that the good stuff, some vitamins at least?

I think a lot of people choose to soak or not to soak, because that is what their parents did or did not do.  But I am looking for the possible best nutrition while using beans.

I know you should always rinse and sort your dry beans to ensure there is no dirt or foreign substances.  And kidney beans, due to their toxicity, needs to be boiled for fifteen minutes if using fresh and not canned.  Even using a crock pot will not take out the toxins, because they do not get to boiling temps.  It needs to be sustained over a short period of time.

I have also heard many to recommend rinsing all canned beans as well if you are worried about your sodium intake and preservatives.  And of course choose BPA Free cans, so the chemicals in the lining do not leech into your food.

So what are your thoughts on soaking beans?",nutrition,0

o6hwt8,Exciting new nutrition science book,"I stumbled across this book, wanted to share it as it seems interesting, but wondering if anyone has heard of it or read it? It's called Naked Nutrition: Stripping the Pseudoscience off the Science (link below). Here's the book description:  Do multivitamin supplements really provide health benefits? How about organic foods? Will one glass of wine a day really improve your health? Are some types of carbs or fats ‘good’ while others are ‘bad’? What does the science say about vegetarian diets and popular weight-loss diets like the keto diet, Atkins diet, Mediterranean diet, and intermittent fasting?  


Unlike any other concise and enjoyable nutrition book for the general public, we have systematically evaluated peer-reviewed scientific publications (citing over 300 recent scientific articles) to answer these questions, so that you don’t have to turn to more questionable sources of nutrition information like celebrities or ‘gurus’ that present pseudoscience, myths, and overly-simplistic information.  
In this book, reviewed by renowned researchers including Dr. Michael F. Holick, who helped identify the circulating and active forms of Vitamin D, you will learn everything from clinical nutrition basics to the most recent research.

Regardless, any wisdom shared is appreciated, as I'm sure someone else out there is wondering about this cryptic subject too. Thanks.

# Can anyone even slightly educated tell me if the estrogen within animal products (such as dairy, eggs, and meat) and estrogen-like compounds found in plants (such as legumes, beans, peanuts, soy, etc.) are an actual physiological concern?

For instance, would eating these things definitely (physically and medically) increase your estrogen receptivity/production levels, even going so far as to stunt growth in adolescents, and give high estrogen symptoms such as enlarged breasts, or does it simply not physiologically work that way, (or perhaps is it not a big of a deal?).

I have heard a myriad of differing opinions, both ""empirically"" (the studies were not conclusive but still concerning) and hearsay wise, (here are some literal examples: Eating animal products and/or phytoestrogenic plants will make you short, eating animal products and/or phytoestrogenic plants will make you tall, phytoestrogens and animal products increase estrogen, phytoestrogens and animal products decrease estrogen )-

\-  I honestly feel utterly insane at this point. Its all contradictory, lending credence to the idea that this is a very misinformed and not well understood topic, but perhaps I am just looking in the wrong places. 

Hence why I am asking you guys, as I'm entirely lost and worried.

\---

If you think they *do* concernedly increase an individuals estrogen, and thence that the estrogen/phytoestrogens within food are genuine physical concerns, I have a few questions, (if you think they *don't*, then just focus on explaining the main question asked above):

\-Does getting fat free variants remove it? Considering estrogen is a fat soluble hormone and all? Or are estrogen/and estrogen-like compounds just ingrained within all of the animal products macronutrients (Proteins/carbs), and not just fat?

\-In most of the (albeit questionable) studies, the estrogen levels are measured through urine. But wouldn't that just show that the excess estrogen is excreted, and not used? Like, doesn't your endocrine system naturally suffice your bodily need for estrogen, and so any excess estrogen consumed via external sources (food) is just ignored and therefore not used? Or am I failing to understand bodily functions?

\-Is this increase actually big enough to have detrimental effects? Or is it at more of a non-potent, residual level, unable to cause things like overactive estrogen receptors, stunted growth, enlarged breasts, lack of libido and so forth, especially in a healthy and active, low BF % individual?

\---

That's all.

Is there any evidence to back this up? I have read about this but never seen any strong studies to back this up.

I have however seen lots of different anecdotal evidence, too much for it to be ignored or for it all to have been made up. Such as men who take too much testosterone that can aromatise and get converted to estrogen; side effect gynecomastia. Bodybuilders even take anti-estrogen to prevent this so it seems that too much estrogen will lead to that in men. However in women progesterone affects breast size during pregnancy and estrogen affects breast size during menstrual cycle. The effects of the pill causing breast enlargement is also widespread. The results in transgender therapy are also evident.

If true what dietary changes could influence hormones such as estrogen and progesterone? What could decrease/increase estrogen or progesterone. Controlling insulin I know about.

o49eqe,This Herb Can Cure Everything Apart from Death Itself," This sounds unreal.

&amp;#x200B;

But this herb is known to “cure everything apart from death itself”.

&amp;#x200B;

I’m talking about black seed oil.

&amp;#x200B;

**Here's what makes this herb so impressive...**

·      Reduces inflammation

·      Prevent diabetes

·      Anti-oxidant

·      Protects your liver

·      Neuroprotective

·      Modulates your immune system

·      Thyroid stimulation

·      Treats skin diseases

·      Relieves pain.

&amp;#x200B;

And another shocking benefit is…

&amp;#x200B;

**It can reduce fear and anxiety.**

&amp;#x200B;

How is it possible?

&amp;#x200B;

To understand that you need to understand what HDAC is…

&amp;#x200B;

Histone deacetylase (HDAC) is an enzyme. If we inhibit it, it keeps genes from being turned off after they’ve been turned on.

&amp;#x200B;

HDAC inhibitors play a critical role in **fear extinction, memory enhancement, social-verbal navigation, addictive behavior extinction and more.**

&amp;#x200B;

Black seed oil contains a mild HDAC inhibitor (*Liang et al., 2017*).

&amp;#x200B;

There are also other HDAC inhibitors like Sodium Butyrate, Vorinostat, Curcumin, Resveratrol, Sulforaphane.

&amp;#x200B;

Furthermore, Black seed oil has potent effects on restoring GABAergic signaling in the brain, which can be **beneficial for anxiety disorder and especially fear** (*Merel et al., 2016*).

&amp;#x200B;

**Unbelievable.**

&amp;#x200B;

It’s hard to believe that something so little can bring so many benefits.

&amp;#x200B;

Black seed oil has always proved its value over time.

&amp;#x200B;

This is a “classic” remedy that now appears to influence one’s fear response and anxiety levels.

&amp;#x200B;

**Which of the black seed oil benefits could be useful for you right now?**

&amp;#x200B;

**Reduced anxiety? Better skin health? Relieved pain?**

o3ui3q,Total calcium intake vs elemental calcium (absorption and daily limit)?,"Being lactose intolerant makes it virtually impossible to reach the recommended daily calcium intake of 1000mg for an adult male. I've noticed that my daily calcium intake has been under 40% DV for at least 2 years.

I've been supplementing with 1 large chicken eggshell every day for the past 10 days. I pressure cook the shells, then remove the membrane and dry them overnight. Using a coffee grinder I grind one eggshell in the morning and separate the powder into 2 servings. You don't have to remove the membrane but I do it for texture mostly.

An hour before a meal I add a teaspoon of lemon juice to 1 serving of eggshell powder and let it soak to transform the calcium carbonate into calcium citrate. According to the research I've done, 1 large chicken eggshell has about 1900mg - 2000mg calcium carbonate which contains 40% elemental calcium. Elemental calcium is what the body can use, so \~800mg of calcium is theoretically the maximum amount you can get from 1 eggshell. Research seems to indicate that the body cannot absorb more than 500mg of calcium per meal so that's why I split my portion into 2. I also pop a vitamim D pill every time I use my homemade concoction.

Is the recommended daily value based on total calcium intake or total elemental calcium that is actually used by your body? My intake right now is around 1000mg elemental calcium but if you count total calcium then it would be over 2000mg. I'm just wondering what I should do long term.

o3oo8a,The REAL Nutritional Value of food. Can someone explain what the labelling on packaging and internet claims really mean?,"How do we determine the real nutritional value of our food? It would seem straight forward, but is it really?  We know many factors are truly involved such as when it was picked, how long and in what condition it traveled in, when you bought it from the store and when you actually ate it, not to mention the cooking method used, should all play a part in the end.

The moment we pick a fruit or vegetable from the ground or vine, the nutritional value begins to degrade.  So something like a bag of potatoes has such and such value.  But is it the optimal value or the worst case scenario value?  Is that the value before or after cooking in the best possible manner, steaming for instance instead of frying?  (Vitamin C for instance could basically be destroyed, although a fresh lemon or lime could restore some.)  Or is it before it is even picked?  And I am sure meat, fish, milk and dairy is the same way.  What did they consume, how stressed they were, how natural the process, etc. should play a factor, plus storage of meat and freshness etc.

Canned food should be simpler, because they have basically put it in a time capsule.   Provided you open and eat it with in their recommended date, you should have all the nutrients.  But is it before you cook or after it?  What if you microwaved in a safe bowl, instead of heating it on the stove in a pot?  What if you ate it straight from the can itself?

I know I have and I am sure other people too have thought, are we getting all our nutrients from such and such because that is what the label says or we were taught in school or online when looking up nutritional values of foods, but are we really getting what how it is labeled?

Edit: I am not speaking of the nutritional value of food served to you at a restaurant, as I assume that is under very specific conditions and controlled, cooked in very specific ways such as grilled, comes from the same source\supplier etc., so what is posted as nutrition is what you get, opposed to fresh and what not that you get yourself and can be cooked yourself and who knows how long it was picked before hand and traveled etc.  Thank you.",nutrition,0

o36vef,1 Gram of Protein for Every Pound or Kilogram of Body Weight?,"Asking this because I keep getting varying answers depending on the source.

My friend continuously told me that the best amount of protein in for an active person is usually somewhere around 1g of protein per pound of bodyweight. When I watched videos talking about macros and calorie count, it also would say something similar that I believed was the same thing.

However, I realized that I was being a dumb American, and most of the videos that I believed also stated this fact were, in fact, saying 1 gram of protein per kilogram, which would be around 1 gram per 2 pounds of body weight. This would mean that, instead of having to consume 150g protein per day, it was more like 75g of protein (well, some would say ~1.2-1.5g/1kg so more realistically around 90-120, which is way more doable for me and my current kitchen situation. 

However, I then looked up other sources to corroborate this realization, and I was only more confused. First, the calculation of pounds to kilograms left me with 75g, which I thought was a little low. Then, the protein calculator said around 90-120, which is not only a large window, but is also somewhere far higher than the 1g/2.2lb rule I just found. Then, I was even more confused when I found that many studies were giving optimal protein counts as in the .73-.8g/1lb range, and they even posited that this range was the optimal range for bodybuilders and athletes that exercise intensely and frequently. Then, I found yet another source that cited a very similar .73-.8g/1lb rule, but also specifified that this was for weight loss and that athletes and the like should try to achieve 1-1.5g/1lb.

I can't find any agreement in the sources. The more I research, the more variation I find in the advice. I am trying to lower by body fat percentage and I work out for 3 times/week, doing a HIIT-style run for 15 mins and then weight training for around 45mins-1hr. If anyone has found a credible answer to this question I would appreciate it. With so much variation, I almost thought that some made the same mistake as me when starting out and mistakenly replaced kilograms for pounds in these sources. However, I doubt that is the ase.",nutrition,0

However I am also hearing that Koreans are high in stomach cancer and Japanese not too far behind (even though they are much healthier in other areas of the body compared to some other countries) and they are both big on fermented foods as well.

Although I suppose with all the vegetables and fermentation that it would help in health in one way, but could lead to stomach cancer which is not a great trade off because of all the spices or high salt content?  Or simply because it is an almost every meal item, almost like rice?  Are they simply over doing it?

Also is there a difference between store bought and home made?  Even with Japanese miso I have heard that most of the good qualities are stripped away in the store processing of it.  But homemade the goodness is kept.  Could that be a contributing factor?  Maybe it is missing it's probiotics?  I am not sure how they are massed produced.  Maybe kimchi is kept old fashioned even bought at stores?

I know even in Japan, even though there is a renaissance of beginning to make your own things again like miso and what not, it takes a lot of effort and a long time to keep at it.  People stopped due to their more modern fast paced lives.  Did the older generations eat as much fermented food and still have the stomach cancer rates?  Maybe it is a store bought issue?

I have even heard store bought sauerkraut is not the same as home made.  Unless of course the homemade process you are not making the brine itself naturally, but in other ways meaning you are not gaining the probiotics.  I think it goes beyond just using store bought vinegar, but actually needs time to naturally ferment with salt or what not.

Anyway I just bought some kimchi.  I enjoy it... I kind of have a love hate relationship with it.  Bought it for motivation due to I wanted the flavor, but also the jar for when I make my own.  =)",nutrition,0

I am looking to purchase peanut butter that is low in sodium. Is there anything in particular to look out for on the labels that will indicate it's low in sodium?

I wanted to avoid forcing them to compare a bunch of different labels.

is there going to be a better chance of low sodium if you get creamy vs crunchy peanut butter, etc? In general is peanut butter going to be very high in sodium?",nutrition,0

When I hear someone say ""I have a fast metabolism so I can eat whatever I want and never gain weight"", my response is that they're either underestimating their exercise or overestimating caloric intake. I'm not an expert but I feel like metabolism isn't as magic as people think it is.

If two people have the same weight, height, muscle mass, and BF%, wouldn't their BMR be in the same ballpark? Give or take a few percent.

Now I'm trying to figure out how to eat more healthy,  to avoid deficiencies. 

Anyway, what I am searching for is information about
* how long vitamins last in food, when fresh, dried, canned, or frozen
* what destroys vitamins, e.g. when cooking it
* how to take supplements. Fat-soluble vitamins should be taken with fats, right?
* bad combos, like red wine and food, since apparently the alcohol destroys some(all?) vitamins? Or breakfast and coffee? 

Also, is it true that some combinations of vitamins will suppress the absorption of other vitamins?  Like taking B9 supplements may cause B12 deficiencies?

Same goes for minerals: It may be broscience, or is it true that calcium suppresses magnesium absorption,  magnesium suppresses zinc, and zinc suppresses copper?

Another thing I wonder about is milk. I love milk and milk is very nutritious on paper. Still, some say that all the phosphorus in milk blocks absorption of some of the nutrients. Is that correct? Are there other similar cases?

Lots of questions,  I know. I want to compile all this info and create a list and stick that list on the fridge for easy access. And share it too if anyone wants it, but the list must be correct.

Of course, eating a large variety of high quality foods is bound to keep you well rounded and ensure you have enough of each nutrient (ignoring those that we should be limiting for the time being). Better yet, the nutrients we aren't actively aware of, as well as obscure phytochemicals will be consumed in a wider variety.

However, I imagine this is somewhat of an optimization problem. If you have a monotonous diet (same foods each day but healthy, and includes proper servings of vegetables and fruit - just less variety), and maintain a bodyweight in the low-mid range of a Health Weight BMI (or ignoring BMI, and consider ""Healthy BMI worth of bodyfat""), at what point of overweightness does the person with the monotonous diet live a healthier life than the slightly overweight counterpart who eats with variety?

Here's a couple of misleading claims I noticed: 

1) TDEE calculators aren't very accurate, therefore CICO isn't a sound theory.

This is the equivalent to saying ""BMI charts aren't good predictors of health because a muscular person could have a BMI that's overweight, therefore obesity isn't really a thing. Sure everyone has different metabolisms and daily activity so a cookie cutter calorie opinion on your height and weight isn't a good predictor, but there's still a daily caloric intake that would maintain your current weight. And one can figure that out by tracking calories and weight and noting when both aren't changing, that's your TDEE.

2) Diabetics without insulin will die emaciated no matter how many calories they consume, thus the ""thermodynamics"" argument is unsound. 

This is like taking a water bottle with holes in it and demonstrating that ""water bottles aren't good at holding water."" Diabetics can't make insulin so their cells literally can't take in the glucose in the blood, so they pee it out. It's not showing that thermodynamics of CICO isn't the whole picture. It's showing that a diabetic can eat and not have it contribute to their calories-in because their cells literally can't take in those calories.

&amp;#x200B;

At the end of the day, different diet strategies help you choose less calorically dense foods and foods that will keep you satiated longer.

This is simple science that should be axiom in this subreddit, and it boggles my mind when I see that that isn't the case.",nutrition,0

""Fermentation reduced the tannin content in the raw samples from 1.93 to 0.12 mg/g. Phytate content reduced from 1.16 to 0.04 mg/g.  The trypsin inhibitor and protease inhibitor also reduced from 1.20 to  0.010 and 1.2 to 0.020 respectively. The production of  alpha-galactosidase by *L. plantarum* (1.8 unit/ml) enhanced the  reduction while the nutritional composition of the food blend in which  the soybean was added improved significantly. The use of  alpha-galactosidase enzyme by *Lactobacillus plantarum* from local food sources is thus shown to reduce anti-nutritional factors in soybeans, which can be of benefit in enhancing the [nutritional quality](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/food-science/nutritive-value) of cereal-legume gruels.""

It is hard to import famous survival bars on the western market. All I can reach is some random Chinese compressed rations bars. I am going to select which bar to buy base on the nutrition tables described. 

Or I want to find food bar similar to the one UN used in humanitarian missions. They are very great foods.

Background: Most IDP being chased and supplies stopped by military. We tried sending rice bags and others supplies but all the 80 bags of rice and medicine are burnt by them. Military also don't let WFP and ICRC missions. What I am planned to do is to smuggle this bars which are less obvious than bags of rice.

There are at least 100K in those camps. Rice will go out in a week or two at this rate. I ordered some PLA compressed rations ahead.",nutrition,0

https://supplementengineer.com/blogs/supplements/new-study-plant-protein-powders-are-inferior-to-whey-protein-isolate

As I understood (and I may be confused, please correct me if I'm wrong), what the study proves is that even if vegan protein sources are processed to make them extremely bio-available (comparably with whey protein) as they usually are when they go into supplements, AND the vegan supplement is created expertly from a variety of sources to match the EAA levels of whey protein, whey protein STILL is more readily absorbed into the blood, and thus better for muscle growth.

Why would this be? I would've thought that if the vegan protein was processed well enough and made bioavailable, and the EAA contents were matched...it would mean they would have the same effects

And like I said...I can't interpret interpret numbers. Is it significant? Is whey protein the winner for supplementation",nutrition,0

However, take the scenario where there are two protein powders, a whey protein powder, and a vegan protein powder that has been blended and enhanced to contain the same BCAA contents as that of the whey.

Will the whey still be more beneficial for muscle growth? If there is a difference, is it significant?

I have a couple questions...

1. Vegan protein is less bio - available than non - vegan protein, but is vegan protein powder an exception to this? I've read in different places that when the vegan protein powder is made, it undergoes some process that makes it almost as bio-available as non - vegan protein
2. 2. According to the aforementioned article, vegan protein powder (even though it came from a mix of protein sources) did not raise EAA levels in the body as much as non - vegan protein powder. However, how big is the difference? Will having a vegan protein shake before bed have not nearly as many benefits as a whey or casein protein shake before bed / after a workout?
3. And finally, for the vegan proteins which are blended as to contain as many EAA's as non - vegan counterparts, are those essential amino - acids as useful when they come from vegan sources as from non - vegan sources?

nuq168,Egg Nutrition Question,"Probably a silly question but I’m morbidly confused. USDA says one large egg had 72 calories, but when cooked in various ways the calories differ. For example a fried egg has about 90ish calories for 46g (standard raw is 50g). Is the USDA accounting for water loss, assuming a 50g raw egg will yield less than 50g fried/cooked/boiled/ etc egg?? Or are they assuming you’ll add oil to fry it ? I also imagine for boiled eggs the boiling somehow changes the composition of the protein of the yolk, hence the difference in calories. That and you also have to boil in the shell. My main curiosity is with the fried/scrambled eggs. 

Might have to experiment. Fry up a few eggs and calculate raw versus cooked calories based on the USDA info to see... but I imagine it’s just them considering water loss during cooking? (Sorry, nutrition nerd here.) 

I also wonder what the calories would be for eggs baked into say, casseroles etc.

nue243,How much sugar-free/diet soda a day will damage your teeth?,"I've been cutting for the past 3 months and I'm embarassed to admit to having drunk way more soda than I usually do. When I'm not cutting I do not drink soda at all - only at parties or when I'm going out to eat which would be maybe once a month. These previous months I've been drinking anywhere from 0.33-1 L of sugar-free/diet soda/pop/energy drinks almost every day. This has made me worried of my dental health. While I'm not afraid of the aritificial sweetners I am concerned about the acidic properties of the sparkling beverages. From what I've been able to gather online the most problematic acid is the pantothenic acid. Now, what I am wondering is how much soda can I safely drink a day without having to worry about damaging my dental health. Is it 1 L? 0,5 L? Or even lower? Thank you in advance.",nutrition,0

I tried to argue but he just kept using anecdotal evidence. He also talked about how trainers he talked to advocated against the use of protein and mentioned a case of a guy competing in a show who suffered a heart attack when posing and he claimed it was due to whey protein.

He also claimed that during bulking, you need to gain fat and minimize protein and then when you cut, you need to maximize protein to build muscle. Weird logic imo

 If there's one cheat day where she eats a lot and goes nuts, would that have less of an effect on the weight loss compared to snacking every day?

It seems that calcium supplements are high on the list of contaminated supplements, but lead is virtually everywhere from exhaust pipe inhalation to tobacco to herbs to soil and paint. Colloidal supplements are notorious for being laden with heavy metals - namely lead. What can be done? Are there home tests that we can test our food, water and supplements before consuming? What kind of detox/chelation is recommended for those who take supplements, teas and herbs that have had an accumulative effect? Suffering from abdominal pain and everything else has been ruled out?

There’s a halal food truck near me. I don’t eat from there often (once every couple of months). But when I do go there, I refrain from eating lamb.

I know that red meat isn’t that great. So I rarely eat it. But I’ve been reading that lamb contains essential nutrients such as iron, zinc,and vitamin B12. However, I have seen their lamb being spit roasted (the meat is on a turning skewer that is held over a large stove). 
I was just wondering this method of cooking depletes the healthy nutrients?
Also, I have read that over cooking meat oxidizes lipids and forms advanced glycation products, and heterocyclic amines, which can be carcinogenic. Would food-truck lamb have large amounts of those?

If it does turn out to retain nutrients and minimize carcinogen formation, then I will have their lamb occasionally (again, once every few months at most).",nutrition,0

I understand that fried foods arent great for you but I am a little confused. Speaking on the oil specifically.... If I am using a ""good"" oil and frying it under the smoke point, is it still considered bad? People cook with healthy oils all the time and make recipes that we deem healthy, so I get the quantity is more with fried foods, but fats being considered bad for you isnt really a thing anymore. So if you are paying attention to what you eat for the most part in general and arnt going nuts, would frying something in a ""healthy"" oil really be that bad? Would it make a difference if what I am frying is relatively healthy  too and only fried for a couple minutes at a time so its not soaking in the oil for hecka long? I found a donut hole recipe thats literally just yogurt and flour and I use good quality ingredients and am planning on experimenting with almond flour, which is literally just almonds. Donut glaze aside of course( honestly i'm a freak and like it plain lol) so There is literally no added sugar in it, made with good quality ingredients and fried in a ""healthier"" oil for like a couple minutes under the smoke point. So what specifically is bad scientifically speaking?

Almond Farmers in California Tear Up Crops Amidst Drought 

In an aerial view, rows of almond trees sit on the ground during an orchard removal project on May 27, 2021, in Snelling, Calif. As the drought emergency takes hold in California, some farmers are having to remove crops that require excessive watering due to a shortage of water in the Central Valley. A Central Valley farmer had 600 acres of his almond orchard removed and shredded and now plans to replace the almonds with a crop the requires less water

The ongoing drought in California has the state's farmers making some tough choices.

Water allocations for many farmers have been cut to zero this year, and water transfers are delayed, forcing some farmers to choose one crop over another, in some cases, tearing up acres of crops that require excessive watering.

This year, California received one of the lowest statewide precipitation totals on record. This was compounded by a warm spring which evaporated much of the Sierra Nevada snowpack that typically feeds nearly 163 billion gallons of water into reservoirs, according to the Times Herald. This year's snowpack is at 0% of normal, according to CA.gov's Snow Water Equivalents page.

As a result, 87% of the West is under at least a moderate drought, up from last year's 40%, U.S. Drought Monitor reports. Most of California's big reservoirs are holding less than half their capacities, and experts blame climate change and this year's La Niña.",nutrition,0

nrf3t5,50 Seemingly Healthy Foods That Are Bad For You,"Microwave Popcorn

With so many light varieties of microwave popcorn on the market, it’s easy to think that this snack is healthy, but with high levels of sodium and the chemical diacetyl, some health professionals caution about making this a regular snack.

A better choice?

Putting a few plain kernels in a brown paper bag, and popping your own. You control the flavoring.

Light Salad Dressings

Have you ever looked at the ingredient list on light salad dressings? They’re about a mile long! Filled with preservatives and other additives you can’t pronounce—not to mention sodium and sugar—you’re much better off drizzling your veggies with a little extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar

Trail Mix Nuts And Dried Fruit

Trail mix is obviously a healthy choice, right? Wrong! While plain, natural mixes of unsalted nuts and unsweetened dried fruits can make for a good portion-controlled, high-energy snack, many mixes throw in chocolate chips, loads of salt, and added sugars. Since a small handful easily contains 300-plus calories, read your nutrition labels closely!

Granola

With rolled oats, nuts, and dried fruits, granola seems so healthy. What is misleading though is how much sugar and extra calories are lurking in granola. A bowl of this stuff can easily contain 500 or more calories—and that’s without the milk! Indulge smartly by choosing high-fiber varieties with low sugar. And stick to the recommended portion size on the label.

Artichoke Spinach Dip

With artichokes and spinach in it, this seems like a veggie-rific dip, but be warned. Just a few tablespoons can pack hundreds of calories and unhealthy fat grams. Instead of ordering this out at a restaurant, try this better-for-you recipe at home. Dip raw veggies instead of chips or crackers for an even healthier swap

Flavored Fat-Free Yogurt

Don’t fall into the fat-free trap. Just because something is fat-free doesn’t make it healthy. In fact, many flavored yogurts have upwards of 15 grams of sugar in that tiny 6-ounce serving! Our advice? Buy plain, fat-free Greek yogurt and flavor it up with some fruit or even a small drizzle of honey. That way, you control what’s in it!

Dried Fruit

While dried fruit does contain fiber, vitamins, and minerals, many companies add sulfur and sugar to make it better for store shelves. While you can buy unsulfured and unsweetened varieties in health food stores, why not just eat fresh fruit instead? It’s much more filling and has fewer calories per serving!

Flavored Soymilk

Soy has many health benefits, including being high in protein and potassium and low in cholesterol. However, those tasty chocolate and vanilla varieties? They add so much sugar and unnecessary calories! Save the flavoured soymilks for the occasional dessert and choose unsweetened or plain varieties for your everyday drinking instead.

Energy Drinks

With so many energy drinks on the market, many of which promise to pump you up and give you a killer workout with added caffeine, vitamins, and minerals, it may be tempting to think that these drinks are healthy, but they aren’t. Similar to supplements, energy drinks aren’t regulated by the FDA, so it’s best to stick to plain ol’ water to rehydrate and whole nutrition to energize!

Smoothies

Smoothies have long been the darling of the health-food world. Although some smoothies made with simple, whole-food ingredients can be healthy, don’t get fooled into thinking anything with the name “smoothie” is good for you. Some smoothies are made with lots of added sugars, high-calorie ingredients like chocolate syrup, or even use full-fat ice cream as a base. Your best smoothie bet? Make one at home so that you know exactly what’s in it!

Turkey Sandwich

You’ve probably heard that when in doubt of what to order out, a turkey sandwich is always a safe bet, right? Well, it depends on where you’re eating. Highly-processed deli meats can be high in nitrates and sodium, which is hard on the heart. Not to mention that turkey sandwiches are oftentimes loaded with full-fat mayo and include huge portions of bread (white or wheat, too much is too much). As always, check those nutritionals before you eat to know what kind of turkey sandwich you’re really getting!

Parfait

Made with yogurt, granola, and fresh fruit, a parfait seems pretty harmless, but a little certainly goes a long way. In fact, unless made at home with the right ingredients, this “healthy” snack can easily contain heavy dessert-like numbers for calories, fat, and sugar. When in doubt, just eat some fresh fruit instead.

Blue Corn

Chips Blue corn chips seem healthier than regular white or yellow corn tortilla chips, but they really aren’t that different, thanks to similar calorie, fat, and sodium counts. Don’t let that rich blue color fool you!

Fish Sandwich

There’s no doubt that fish is healthy. But when you fry it, coat a bun with butter, and layer on tartar sauce or mayo, there’s little “health” left in it. To get the full benefits of fish, skip the sandwich altogether and enjoy a plain grilled fillet with some steamed veggies and rice pilaf instead!

Chicken Wrap

There was a time about 10 years ago when anything in a wrap became synonymous with “health food.” Problem is, even when you fill wheat tortillas up with tons of veggies and lean protein, the ginormous tortilla itself can contain 400 to 800 calories—not to mention the high-calorie sauces usually in them. Your best bet is to split a wrap with a friend or order it sans tortilla!

Low-Fat Muffins

The low-fat muffins at coffee shops always look so good. And although they are a reduced-fat version of the full-fat muffins they sit next to, they are by no means actually healthy. In fact, when most manufacturers take fat out, they have to replace it with something to make up for the lack of taste. And that something is usually sugar, making most low-fat muffins not even that less caloric than their full-fat counterparts and probably less filling.

Gluten-Free Products

Gluten-free products are all the rage these days. Although some gluten-free products are healthy, by no means does the label “gluten-free” equate to health. If it’s packaged or processed — gluten or no gluten — it’s not as healthy as other whole foods you could be eating. The best gluten-free foods aren’t products at all; They’re fresh fruits and vegetables!

Frozen Diet Dinners

A pre-portioned frozen meal may be convenient and seem like a great way to keep your calories in check, but when it comes to nutrition, most diet dinners just don’t stack up. Filled with preservatives, too much sodium, and few veggies, these are better left in the freezer case.

Canned Soups

Canned soups can make for a filling lunch or dinner, but even the reduced-sodium and low-fat version aren’t as healthy as they seem. Most cans of soup have 400 or more milligrams of sodium per cup—and really, who just eats half the can? High sodium can raise blood pressure, lead to bloating, and just generally make you feel sluggish. No fun!

Veggie Pizza

We all know pizza isn’t the healthiest food choice, but veggie pizza? It has vegetables, so it must be healthy, right? Not so fast. Some fast-food joints load their veggie pizza with extra cheese to make up for the lack of meat or use oil-soaked dried tomatoes and olives for flavor. Your best bet? Go for thin crust veggie pizza with half the cheese, watch portion sizes closely, or consider making your own at home!

Spinach Pasta

Pasta made with spinach may seem healthier than white (or even wheat) pasta, but sadly, it’s not. Although the noodles may be green, the amount of spinach actually in there is so small that it doesn’t add up to much benefit—and it certainly doesn’t justify eating a huge bowl of it. You’re far better off having a half cup of whole-wheat pasta and a side salad with spinach.

Wheat Bread

Don’t be fooled by wheat-bread products. If the package doesn’t specifically say “100-percent whole wheat,” then it’s probably mostly white bread with just a little wheat flour mixed in for marketing. Also: Make sure each slice has at least 2 grams of fiber—another mark of a truly healthy bread.

Diet Soda

The word “diet” doesn’t always equal healthy, and that’s certainly the case for diet soda. Made with artificial ingredients and flavorings, it’s not only unnatural and high in sodium, but regular diet soda drinkers have been shown to eat more calories after consuming diet cola. While the reasons aren’t fully understood, researchers suspect it’s the body’s way of making up for calories it thinks it received in the diet soda but didn’t.

Reduced-Fat Peanut Butter

Peanuts are full of healthy monounsaturated fats, so when it comes to choosing a peanut butter, it’s best to go with a natural version of the full-fat variety. Most reduced-fat versions contain the same number of calories per serving because when they take the fat out, they add sugar and other fillers in. Ick!

Fruit Cocktail

It seems simple enough. Fruit is healthy, so a fruit cocktail should be a good choice. But most fruit cocktails are made with a sugary syrup that does nothing but drive the calories up without adding any nutritional value. You’re better off eating a piece or two of fresh fruit instead!

Fruit Juice

Don’t get us wrong, 100-percent fruit juice does contain tons of vitamins and minerals. However, unless you’re looking to gain weight or subsist on a liquid-only diet (um, no fun!), fruit juice is a quick way to drink a bunch of calories without filling you up. Not to mention that many fruit juices on the market don’t even contain 100 perfect fruit juice! Instead of drinking your juice, make a point to chow down on two to three servings of whole fruit a day.

Baked Beans

Beans are awesome because they’re so high in fiber and are a plant-based source of protein. But baked beans—particularly the canned kinds in all flavors—can also be extremely high in sodium, sugar, and additives. What’s a girl to do? Be savvy about reading those labels, or make some at home where you control the seasoning.

Pretzels

With less fat than potato chips, these have been called “healthy” since the fat-free craze of the 90s. However, most pretzels have no real nutritional value and are made with white flavor, which quickly converts to sugar in your bloodstream, spiking your blood sugar and causing you to want to eat more and more. (Ever notice how pretzels rarely fill you up? That’s why!) Unless you’re training for a long-distance event or are eating them with another dish that includes fiber and protein, you’re better off avoiding pretzels.

Pasta Primavera

Since pasta primavera is usually made with lots of fresh spring vegetables, it probably seems like a smart choice on the Italian menu. But don’t get bamboozled. Unless you’re the one preparing it, there’s a good chance the finished dish will be overloaded with cheese and oil, making this “light” meal, not so light at all!

Veggie Chips

The pieces of actual veggies in veggie chips are so thin and so processed—whether they’re baked or fried—that most of the nutrition from the original vegetable is gone. Again, you’re better off eating raw veggies instead! Are you noticing a theme?

Protein Bars

It’s impossible to generalize that all protein bars are unhealthy, but it’s safe to say that if you flip most of them over and read the nutrition info, you might be shocked. Unless organic, most protein bars are highly processed, even featuring artificial ingredients and fillers. Bottom line, if your protein bar has more than 200 calories or 8 grams of sugar, it’s more like a candy bar with added protein than health food.

Sports Drinks

Don’t be fooled by misleading labels: sports drinks are little more than flavored water mixed with sugar and electrolytes. Sports drinks are ideal for workouts that last longer than an hour or for when you’re working out in hot weather and sweating a lot, but for a short indoor workout or just as a beverage? No way, man.

Tea Drinks

Don’t get us wrong. Tea is healthy—when you brew it and control what’s in it. But when you buy flavored tea in a bottle or can? Lots of added sugar, sodium, and artificial flavorings get involved, making this drink less than ideal.

Rice Cakes

Another darling of the 90s dieting-decade, rice cakes may have a nice crunch with few calories, but there’s little nutritional value in them. Plus, the new flavored varieties have the added downside of having sugar and salt in them. While fine as a treat in moderation, these aren’t really giving your body much nutrition.

Frozen Yogurt

In almost all cases, frozen yogurt is better for you than full-fat ice cream. However, that doesn’t give fro-yo a free pass to become a regular staple in your diet. No matter how many types or toppings they come out with, it’s still a treat that’s high in sugar and can quickly add up in calories if you don’t keep portion sizes to a half-cup (which is so little!).

Granola Bars

No matter if the granola bars in question have fruit, nuts, chocolate chips, or a ridiculous amount of fiber, they’re almost always very high in sugar (which is usually high-fructose corn syrup) and low in nutrients. If you need a snack on the run, you’re much better off having an apple and a handful of almonds. About the same calories, and your body can use it!

Organic Snack Foods And Cookies

Just because something is organic doesn’t mean that it’s healthy. Remember, organic or not, junk food is junk food!

Dried Veggies

Dried veggies as salad toppings are somewhat new to the grocery store aisles. While they seem healthy and provide a nice crunch to salads, they also add salt and calories without many vitamins. Trade them for unsalted sunflower seeds to get that crunch with vitamin E, magnesium, and thiamine.

Flavored Nuts

Nuts are a wonderful healthy food when eaten in moderation. But roasted nuts? They take a good thing and coat it with not-so-great things like sugar and salt. Try to limit your nut consumption to plain raw nuts. And if you want to make your own flavored nuts, roast some in the oven with spices like turmeric, pepper, or even hot sauce!

Fast-Food Salads

Salads can be healthy or incredibly unhealthy, especially at fast-food and chain restaurants. Research calorie counts before you dine, and don’t forget to check the nutritional on salad toppers like croutons, nuts, and salad dressings. Extras like these can quickly turn a healthy salad into a calorie bomb.

Protein Shakes

Protein is important for our bodies to build muscle and stay strong, but regularly downing protein shakes in place of meals isn’t healthy. Many are highly processed, high in sugar, and despite being fortified with vitamins and minerals, you’re missing out on having real healthy and filling food.

Croutons

Whether they’re whole-wheat or white, baked or fried, croutons don’t offer much nutritional value. If you like them for their crunch, try tossing crunchy veggies like green pepper strips or heart-healthy walnuts in your salad instead.

Signature Sushi Rolls

We always think of sushi as being so healthy and low calorie. While it can be, those house-specialty rolls that include mayo, cream cheese, or anything fried? Warning! Unhealthy food! Here’s a good rule to follow: If you wouldn’t consider an ingredient healthy on its own, don’t expect it to be any healthier just because it’s wrapped in nori!

Veggie Burger

Although some veggie burgers are filled with healthy beans, mushrooms, brown rice, and vegetables, others—especially those at restaurants—can be far from healthy. They’re often held together by butter or oil and large enough to make up two to three meals.

Veggie Omelet

Ordering a veggie omelet at a breakfast diner can be a good choice, but you have to order one like Meg Ryan from When Harry Met Sally: no oil or butter, no cheese, egg whites only, and steamed veggies (not veggies sautéed in oil). Jump through those nutritional hoops, and you can keep considering this healthy.

Turkey Burger

Sure, a turkey burger is leaner than ground beef. But that doesn’t always mean a turkey burger is a healthy choice. Pay particular attention to what type of ground turkey it is (turkey breast is the most lean) and the toppings. Some sugary cranberry sauce here, a piece of cheese there, and a buttered bun on top are sure-fire ways to turn this burger into a calorie bomb.

Grilled Portabella Sandwich

This meat-free sandwich sure is delicious—but beware if you’re ordering it out. Mushrooms absorb flavours like a sponge and chefs are notorious for soaking them in salty condiments and oils. And don’t even get us started on the cheesy toppings and massive buns they can come on!

Fruit Snacks

Whether it’s a fruit roll-up or those little gummy fruit snacks, even if it’s all natural, you’re better off eating a piece of real fruit. You’ll be more satiated, you’ll consume less sugar and calories, and you’ll get more nutrition bite for delicious bite.

Multi-Grain Chips

Choosing whole-grain chips over potato chips may be a smart snack choice. The problem is, you tend to eat more of the multi-grain version because they’re billed as “healthy.” Unless you’re indulging, get your whole grains from more nutritious sources such as quinoa, wild rice, or beans.

nr58wb,Ive been dieting for the past few months now. Meals are convenience and budget focused. Have started to finally shed weight. Dieting doesnt have to be miserable. But I was also looking for any advice. Anything I could change?,"Breakfast:

2 eggs. 2 slices wheat toast. No butter. But mayo on bread and sriracha. Its actually not bad. 

Lunch:

Cobb salad. Blue cheese. I buy a box of mixed greens with arugala, spinach, kale. Cherry tomatoes. Red onions. One chicken breast. Then I think 2, maybe 3 spoons of dressing. I dont have a way of measuring at work, more a guess. I add a bit at a time and keep tossing til its good. 

Sometimes I run out of stuff or forget to make lunch, so I'll get a sub from a grocery store. Wheat bread, half sub. Roast beef, or turkey. Cheese. Usually a combination of pickles, cucumbers, banana peppers, spinach, 

Dinner:

Ive decided to go with stir fry. 1 skinless chicken breast + a cup of frozen veggies (broccoli, carrots, cauliflower). Ive also found tossing chicken in a little bit of oil for any rubs before cooking really helps keep it a bit tender, just a tip. 

Im learning teriyaki sauce. Will have to remember how to do orange sauce as well. I remember its mostly made up of store bought OJ. The rest is rice wine vinegar. I believe theres no added sugar. My teriyaki sauce should have less than 2 spoons of sugar or so. 

I drink a cup of black coffee in the morning. And a large cup of cold brew at lunch with oatmilk from dunkin. This is probably the unhealthiest part of my day, next to dinner.

Weekends Ive designated as cheat times of course. But Im still holding back on, I think. I'll eat one or two fattening things a day. Maybe go out to eat and get a full course, and count it as the 2. Or a soda, candy, dessert(depending on size) etc. would count as 1. The rest of my day stays just about the same as the weekdays. 

Just kinda figuring it out as I go. I do excercise regularly. Ive had to take a few weeks off, but have lost 10 pounds during this break. Really looking forward to seeing what happens when I go back.",nutrition,0

Every day, I drink an Ensure plus (this is a version of ensure with some extra calories added in). I am trying to understand if these are unhealthy. The only thing that worries me is the sugar content; there are 20g of sugar in 1 bottle of ensure plus. After reading, I've come to understand that sugar itself isn't bad to consume - the problems come from your body's reaction to sugar(?), such as your body absorbing it too quickly and creating a blood sugar spikes. One way to reduce a blood sugar spike, is to eat fiber at the same time you're eating sugar - this is why, as I understand, the sugar in say an apple isn't a big deal, because there's fiber bundled with it, so your body absorbs the sugar slowly.

So I decided to compare the ensure plus to an apple - according to google, a medium sized apple has 19g of sugar, and 4 g of fiber. Comparing this to Ensure plus, which has 20g of sugar and 3g of fiber. (the version i get at least, which has fiber added.) These seem similar to me.

Am I missing something here, with regards to what's bad about the sugar in ensure? I would really appreciate any insight. Thanks!",nutrition,0

If you eat IIFYM and get all the nutrients, proteins etc that you need, what does it differ from ""clean eating"", and if IIFYM actually work just as good as ""clean eating"" as some claim it does, then why do pro athletes and bodybuilders generally not eat IIFYM? There are so many people being 100% certain about their ""side"" on this debate, but I rarely see anything based on actual research, it's rather more about what people feel like would make sense, which isn't a good way of arguing regarding these kinds of subjects.

Same thing on the other side of the spectrum, you have people like Coach Greg saying calories in, calories out, meaning it doesn't matter what you eat as long as you hit your daily calories. But is there anything to actually support this?

I have been looking for a juice recipe that contain most if not all type of vitamin and micro nutrient, electrolyte and everything else my body need. Dont need to contain 100% daily value, just some of it. 

I dont want it to be a smoothie though. I want to be able to make a huge pot of it and either can it or just store it in the fridge and drink some every day.

Something I can drink with my lunch at work. Something that i can bring while hiking and camping.

Right now, im using the small v8 can. but id like to have something even better. I dont intend for that drink to be my only source of anything, but id love to have a nice supplement than can quench my thirst at the same time.

Decided to go back to school for nutrition. Got into Hunter College in NYC. Moved in to a retail job to make money. 

Hunter wouldn’t let me start nutrition without prerequisites, most of which I had already taken but the credits wouldn’t transfer. Working full time and taking classes I wasn’t interested in (ones that had nothing to do with nutrition) burnt me out, and I started losing focus and eventually dropped out. Money was a huge factor, I couldn’t afford school. 

That was 2010-2013. During this time I had only taken 1 class in nutrition. I still have the itch, I still want to learn this and help people. I have a good job now, but I still have this desire for more. 

I recently signed up for a certificate program through NASM. I’m wondering if this is way to go, seems like a good first step. Any other advice on where to learn the basics to see if I *really* want to pursue this? Feeling lost and don’t know where to start.

Estrogen produced by aromatization of gonadal androgen has an important facilitative role in male-typical aggressive behavior that is mediated through its interaction with estrogen receptors (ER) in the brain. Isoflavones found in soybeans and soy-based dietary supplements bind ER and have dose- and tissue-dependent effects on estrogen-mediated responses. Yet, effects of isoflavone-rich diets on social and aggressive behavior have not been studied. We studied the effects of long-term (15 months) consumption of diets rich in soy isoflavones on spontaneous social behavior among adult male cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) (n = 44) living in nine stable social groups. There were three experimental conditions which differed only by the source of dietary protein: casein and lactalbumin (no isoflavones), soy protein isolate containing 0.94 mg isoflavones/g protein, and soy protein isolate containing 1.88 mg isoflavones/g protein. In the monkeys fed the higher amount of isoflavones, frequencies of intense aggressive (67% higher) and submissive (203% higher) behavior were elevated relative to monkeys fed the control diet (P's &lt; 0.05). In addition, the proportion of time spent by these monkeys in physical contact with other monkeys was reduced by 68%, time spent in proximity to other monkeys was reduced 50%, and time spent alone was increased 30% (P's &lt; 0.02). There were no effects of treatment on serum testosterone or estradiol concentrations or the response of plasma testosterone to exogenous gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). The results indicate that long-term consumption of a diet rich in soy isoflavones can have marked influences on patterns of aggressive and social behavior.",nutrition,0

May I get your opinions about producing and preserving home made chili garlic oil?

You see, we make chili garlic oil through frying the ingredients for about 4-6 hours in oil. Therefore the ingredients aren't fresh ingredients but cooked ingredients. But we only use garlic, red chili, black bean paste, and oil. We don't use any vinegar or any ingredient with acidity that can prevent botulism toxin formation.

We store the oil in containers that don't seem to be airtight. And we keep them refrigerated. 

Should we freeze the oils instead?

nnkqsp,Longterm Effects of Olive Oil/Butter Consumption,"The title kicks this impending query off, I'm a Palestinian and like our Italian counterparts, we consume olive oil on a daily basis. One cannot deny the health benefits of olive oil assuredly, yet I am genuinely curious about something:

How does long term consumption of olive oil/butter affect the body? 

What of direct effects of using olive oil to cook eggs or meats in the morning as opposed to butter use? 

Would one be preferable in nutritional intake than the other? 

Finally, I tend to mix a small teaspoon of pure unsalted butter (I've been using a wonderful Ukrainian brand recently that is absolutely brilliant in scent, consistency and taste) with two tablespoons of olive oil in the morning to cook my breakfast. How does that actually affect the body? A mixture of both that is. 
Note: I do it because butter mitigates the burn level of oil, as eggs for instance cook better with hot oil as opposed to warm oil. 

Bonus: Some use سمن بلدي or ghee. Smells absolutely horrible if you ask me, but apparently there are health benefits according to some, but I feel that might be untrue. Professional opinions?",nutrition,0

nn5pnv,The latest Silicon Valley project...,"  

I hope you and your loved ones are doing well in these unprecedented times.  
 

I am not sure how closely you have been following the cryptocurrency news recently. In case you have not joined the Pi Network yet, I am sending you an invitation.  
 

Pi is a new digital currency introduced on Pi Day (3/14) in 2019. It is a new type of blockchain technology developed at Stanford. It uses smartphones instead of computers. The ""mining"" process for each coin does not require solving puzzles, wasting energy, or using your phone data. You just mine it by tapping the app once a day to confirm you are human.  
 

As part of your invitation, I am sending you 1π!

To claim your Pi, download the Pi Network app (on an iPhone or Android device) and use my username (DrEEEEE) as your invitation code.  
 

Pi is not a scam. You can Google it, search for the core team members and view their published articles and citations on Google Scholar, view their social media to confirm network growth and updates, watch countless videos from many trusted sources explaining the technology and concept. The Pi Network channel on Youtube is hosted by the founders explaining the network and technology in the videos. You should also check out the comments and questions below those videos to see the intense enthusiasm and interest in this new project. Once you download the app, you can also view the latest information and messages from core team members, who are all Standford University Ph.D. and MBA recipients. The founder, my colleague Dr. Kokkalis, lectures a cryptocurrency course at Stanford, so their updates include the videos of these lectures as well. I have learned quite a lot from them just in the past few weeks since I joined.  
 

The network is growing quickly. It reached 14 million members last month. The core team members plan to close the network and end the mining process when the network reaches around 100 million members. At that time, you will be able to trade the Pi you have mined for actual currencies, just like Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency. The members of the network will also be rewarded for any transaction fees collected and advertising revenue from their app. Also, their network is already open to programmers to develop apps specific to that network. All of the revenue generated will also be shared with the network members daily. The daily active users and the large ecosystem created by the network give Pi a certain value other cryptocurrencies do not possess.  
 

Pi was launched as a three-phase project. The first phase involved growing the network and mining a limited number of coins. The second phase of testing the network is already running. The third and final phase will be Mainnet. This is the phase where you can actually trade the Pi you have earned. The Mainnet phase is expected to be launched within months.   
 

As the network expands, the mining rate (currently 0.1 Pi per hour) is cut in half at each benchmark, such as 10 million, 100 million members, etc. This halving is intended to create the ""scarcity"" concept. Similar to Bitcoin, the total number of Pi created will be limited. I am sure you have heard the Bitcoin halving (mining rate being cut in half) last year created enormous demand, sending the price of one Bitcoin to over $61K recently! At this time, we don't know exactly how much each Pi will be worth once trading starts at the third phase of the project. Estimates range from a few cents to a few dollars per Pi. However, it is not unusual for a new cryptocurrency to experience 100 or even 1000-fold increases in value within a year. In case you are not familiar with cryptocurrency values, you can search historical prices for Bitcoin and Ether to see these exponential increases.

 Once you join the network, you will also be receiving 25% of the Pi I am mining daily as a bonus. This also applies to everyone who joins your team in the future. This incentive structure has helped them grow their network so quickly. The app also allows you to see how much your ""team"" is mining in real-time. Pretty exciting and engaging, in my opinion. You can currently mine almost 3 Pi a day with just me as your one team member to start. If you have a decent size network, that number can get much higher.  
 

Feel free to read the FAQ and white paper explaining the concept on their secure website, minepi dot com. Once you download the app you will need the invitation code DrEEEEE to create your account, since every member needs an invitation to sign up. When you accept you will see me listed as a verified member, under your Earning Team.  
 

Keep in mind that they are planning to close the network when they reach around 100 million members and the Pi mining rate will eventually be reduced to zero, limiting the total number of Pi in circulation and increasing the value of each Pi mined until then. The network growth rate so far seems to be around 20% a month and Pi already has more daily active users than any other cryptocurrency!   
 

If you have any questions about Pi, the technology, digital currencies, or finance in general, I am happy to help any time.  
 

Happy mining 😊",nutrition,0

nmvghv,Protein -- what's the science behind the wide range of recommendations?,"A little while ago I started deliberately increasing my protein intake to help with some minor weight loss (8 pounds down, about 4 to go!). Despite the deliberate increase, I doubt that I'm getting more than 20-25% of calories from protein, usually less. I've gone back and forth on the importance of protein. When I was younger, I veered toward a mostly vegetarian diet and thought that I was getting enough protein that way (I know that you *can* but I don't think I necessarily was). Now I'm eating more meat again, and more of it, but my husband and son are vegetarians, and I worry that they don't get enough protein... just like my mother always used to fret about when I was a kid. We are all physically active and I'm not young (50).

The recommendations I've seen range from 10-35% of calories (plus one weight loss diet that recommends 40% protein, but that's an outlier). For grams per unit of body weight, it ranges from 0.36 grams of protein per pound or 0.8 grams per kg to triple that amount.

nmu1u1,Why is there not more talk about how gluten is bad?,"As a source of protein, it is not very good. There is a lack of essential amino acids and in terms of nutritional value, gluten is very bad for growing protein mass.

All over the world, the recipe for bread has changed completely over the last 50 years. As a result, more and more people are saying that their body cannot tolerate gluten. Thus, the number of people with gluten intolerance has quadrupled in the last 60 years worldwide.

Gluten is generally a difficult-to-digest protein. It doesn't cost very much to eat it. If the amount of gluten gets high, problems can occur. Some tolerate a lot of gluten and some just feel bad.

Is gluten safe?
We do not know exactly yet, but the first studies in animal experiments already show that such compounds may have an activity that can cause inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract.

At least 50 epitopes of gluten may produce cytotoxic, immunomodulatory, and gut-permeating activitities.

It looks like gluten is not only bad for people with gluten intolerance but also for the people without it. Repeated exposure to gluten could possibly cause intolerance.",nutrition,0

Ever since I've broken those habits, of fast food constantly, and shoving garbage into my gullet like thousands of Midwesterners, I see it everywhere, constantly. People who are living this life I used to live, being morbidly obese, thinking that it's all their choice. That's what they want you to think I feel...yes, it's your choice, but in order to make those choices, you have to essentially abandon your culture. That's not right. 

40 percent of the country is now obese, up 26 percent from 2008. 2/3 are overweight.  This is not an individual problem. 

Cornell Univeristy published a study in regards to the costs of obesity. Allegedly, 29% of healthcare costs are correlated with obesity.

Here's the relevant quote - ""The science doesn’t lie, and I needed to see that data to understand the extent of the damage I was doing to my body. They did metabolic testing, which showed I was using protein stores for energy, instead of fat I already had stored. This meant my body was taking from lean muscle mass, my immune system, and my organs for energy, instead of the nutrients I was taking in. An EKG showed an irregular heart rhythm that is consistent with restriction. No one had bothered to test for this before. My bone density test showed osteopenia, the condition that comes before osteoporosis.""  


It's not that I don't believe this individual. It's just that due to my relative ignorance, I'm unable to reconcile someone having large amounts of fat stored in their body with their body ignoring said fat and choosing to feed off of their ""lean muscle mass, immune system and organs.""

***Tl;dr: I want nutrition resources/books that's not biased and is science based (cite everything, use peer-reviewed studies). I would also like it if it discussed eating around the world in the past and how come they all were relatively healthy despite very different eating styles***

I am fat, and I've been investigating the reasons behind my fatness, and decided to cut sugar and processed food out of my system.  I've read some books on nutrition (diet in general), and while I'm almost always skeptical, I tend to take some messages away. For example I read the obesity code, while I don't believe fasting will solve all of my problems (it didn't and I've been doing it for a couple of years now), I like it and enjoy fasting. I noticed how much it controls my hunger and how I have a clearer mind when fasting so I simply skip breakfast now. 

before continuing, I just want to point out that I believe losing weight is the best way to fight insulin resistance and I also know CICO is the principle. I actually remember reading about a research in which the dieter only consumed sweats but limited their calories, and they lost weight AND improved insulin and stuff. I'm only cutting sweats because I feel like I'm an addict and I don't know how to eat sugar in moderation.

Anyways, when I'm dieting, I like looking at resources and such to keep me motivated, and I also really like reading about it. I noticed recently, however, that resources sometimes say the stupidest things I have ever heard. Sometimes they say something SO baffling to me I can't believe it. But I'm not sure if they're actually right and I'm just misinformed or if they're straight up lying. Examples:  


* many vegans claim that meat can cause cancer. Is this true? how? if two people are healthy, eating balanced diet, one is vegan and one is not, will the non-vegan has higher chance of cancer? or did they just say this because the majority of unhealthy people are nonvegan thus have more chances of cancer?
* I watch Eric Berg in youtube, he is a doctor. I liked many of his videos although I found it a bit extreme. However, youtube recommended two videos today to me and they're BIZARRE! In one video, he claimed that fruits are UNHEALTHY???? I mean I get it if you're too fat or diabetes is killing you tomorrow, but for a healthy person? really???? the second video he claimed that drinking water is unnecessary and that it's a scam by ""they"" -whatever that means- and that he only drinks two cups of water a day. I have heard and saw many people experience complications because of not drinking water. I have NEVER heard of someone dying of ""too much water"" however. 
* the big debate of high carbs vs high fat. It seems like everyone agree with eating more protein, but should we fill the rest with carbs or fat? if two healthy people ate within their calories lots of protein and healthy food, one person is eating the rest from carbs and the other is eating the rest from fat, is one better than the other?
* whole grains: are they bad or good? like rice, pasta, bread and so on. I personally eat them and pretty much never overeat with them. But I always see people suggesting cutting them for health. Why?

Basically, I feel like I'm lost. I've read many health guides, but I find them very contradicting sometimes. I want a nutrition book that cite EVERYTHING it says. preferably explains in science and not biased toward a certain diet (obesity code was very keto-biased for example). I'm tired of reading off the internet as everyone can claim anything now :(

Also, it always baffles me how people from different places in the world ate differently. Where they all healthy? I know that in Japan, the poor used to ate rice with pretty much nothing else, which caused many health complications from vitamin deficiencies.  

But from what I see, it seems like everyone was healthy. For example, I come from a part of the world where my grandparents fasted regularly, once a month each year + twice a week + 3 times a month. In addition to eating fat and meat exclusively with minimal vegetables and fruit (except for dates, because it's too hot nothing else grows lol). They rarely ate wheat too. They were fine and lived quite long and so did my great great grandparents. So when you look at them, you might say that keto works. But then what about Mediterranean diet, where they ate many fruit and vegetables and added oil to them too (so basically high carb high fat), but they also were fine? finally vegans in india and asia, they are also fine despite avoiding meat. I would like a book that discuss this too

njlnw6,A question about sugar vs sugar-free energy drinks,"According to what I have heard (please correct this if it is wrong), normal sugar energy drinks provide a bunch of energy not from the caffeine, but from the sugar + caffeine. Basically, each of them on their own is a necessary but not sufficient condition. It's the combination of them that packs a punch.

We now have sugar-free energy drinks, some of which say zero calories. If the artificial sweetener has zero calories, how is it still helping provide energy, as calories are, roughly speaking, a measure of energy, are they not?",nutrition,0

njgktl,how safe would this salt be,"Hi,

I'm thinking about making my own fasting salts. [A mix of NaCl, KCl and MgCl2-something-something is commercially available](https://www.amazon.com/Fasting-Salts-Intermittent-Flavourings-Sweeteners/dp/B07Z55FLJC), but it's really way too expensive for what it really is.

Please, I would like this post to be strictly focused on the ""recipe"", not about fasting.

Based on the label and a few calculations, I've found that magnesium dichloride pentahydrate is used as magnesium salt. I found KCl [here](https://www.mon-droguiste.com/chlorure-potassium.html) and magnesium dichloride **hexa**hydrate [here](https://www.mon-droguiste.com/chlorure-magnesium.html).

For a 20g serving (or serving-equivalent in case of hexahydrate), these are the weights of salts needed:

* NaCl, table salt: 12.95g.
* KCl: 4.77g.
* Magnesium dichloride pentahydrate: 2.29g ; 2.51g if using hexahydrate in order to have the same amount of Mg in the serving (which then becomes slightly more than 20g).

The sum is pretty much just 20g, so my calculations are probably alright.

My questions:

* Would this be safe for human consumption?
* Can pentahydrate be replaced by hexahydrate, provided I adjust the quantity to keep the Mg in balance?
* I'm guessing that shredding/mixing everything together would result in the denser compound to fall to the bottom of the jar. I'm thinking that perhaps this should be mixed, diluted in water, dried up, then kept in not-so-fine grains?

Thank you.

&amp;#x200B;

Calculations to reach my findings:

* (weight of Na/K/Mg) / (molar mass of Na/K/Mg) gives the number of moles of Na/K/Mg. E.g. 5135 / 22.990 = 223.358mmol for Na.
* As there's only 1 of Na/K/Mg in the base salts, we have (amount of Na/K/Mg moles) \* (molar mass of salt compound) = weight of salt compound we need. E.g. 223.358mmol \* 57.99 = 12.95g for NaCl.",nutrition,0

niqtep,what oil is cold pressed unsaturated fat and can be used with high heat?,"It seems everything I had thought to be true is untrue about oils and fats.

I thought unsaturated was GOOD. But it is not if it's refined, as in canola oil. Refined oil causes scars on blood vessels =&gt; cholesterol is used repair mechanism =&gt; calcification =&gt; cardio problems.

I thought food high in cholesterol was the reason cholesterol rises but no, it's regulated and if it rises it's because system wants it to rise. usually it's due to inflammation/damage somewhere.


Long story short, my research seems to indicate these are best oils/fats to use for cooking, in descending order:

1. Unsaturated, cold-pressed, high temp compatible (???)

2a. Unsaturated, cold-pressed, not good for frying (olive oil)

2b. Saturated, good for med heat (butter)

3. Unsaturated, refined, high temp compatible (canola oil)

4. anything with trans fat (worst)

nim2sx,"A question that has been posted in other forms. I apologize if its been asked before but I struggled to find a specific answer when googling my question ""+ reddit"" in google."," I do absolutely love breakfast and I am aware that it is so easy to just make a piece of toast and two eggs with a more filling and energizing meal. But recently I have noticed there have been days where for whatever reason I'm either too busy, lazy, or late to make breakfast. 

I wanted to ask about recommendations for meal replacement shakes or bars that are specific to the morning that I can grab and go, that doesn't taste like sand, and/or are high in protein....(I do not want to use the world ""healthy"" with these meal replacements, I'm aware they aren't the best)

Alternatively, I'm open to hearing about other options as well or just simple comments about ingredients to look for/avoid.

Finally, I did do a google search with variations of my question and adding ""reddit"" at the end. I found some similar posts but nothing specific to store/over-the-counter brands. 

* I did see **many** posts from people who make their own protein smoothies in the morning and while they all looked amazing, I'd like to avoid that kind of advice primarily because the effort would be the same or more as making a regular breakfast (and yes maybe I should just make a ton of shakes in advance idk)

However, sunflower seed butter is delicious and an alternative for people with a nut/almond allergy, like me. Tahini is fine, but quite bitter so IMO it's not very nice to use tahini the same way as people use almond and nut butters, i.e. on toast and oatmeal (I know some people like tahini on oatmeal but I don't). But I'm a bit uncertain if the fatty acid profile of sunflower seed butter is too bad to consume as an alternative to nut butters?
